         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <hi>MANY Daughters have done Vertuouſly, and thou excelleſt them all,</hi> was a <hi>Motto</hi> on the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial of Q. <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> hung up in moſt Churches, for the good Laws ſhe made againſt Popery. What high En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comiums of Praiſe, and great Retributions of Thanks, then are due to you, right Chriſtian Senators, for your warm Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſing His Majeſty to ſuppreſs the Blaſphemy and Debau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery which the Nation abounds with? And upon His wiſe referring back ſo great a Work to your ſelves, to effect it by an Act of Parliament, for your thereupon forming the late good Act, wherein it is, to your great Honour, Enacted, <hi>That if any Perſon........ ſhall by Writing, Printing, Teaching, or adviſed Speaking, deny any One of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, in the Holy Trinity, to be God, or ſhall aſſert or maintain there are more Gods than One, or ſhall deny the Chriſtian Religion to be True, or the Holy Scriptures, of the Old and New Teſtament, to be of Divine Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi> ſhall ſuffer ſo and ſo. Although there be no Reward to the Proſecutor, it is hoped you have thereby, in a good mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, put a ſtop to the carriere of the Prophane Tongues and
<pb facs="tcp:41406:3"/> Pens of a debauched Crew of this Age, that Impiouſly deny the Trinity of Perſons in the Godhead, that mock at all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed Religion, as contained in the Scriptures, that call the Scriptures an Inken Divinity, and the Blood of our Lord Jeſus, as the Blood of another good Man, and make his dreadful Agony and Sufferings, but <hi>Facile Repreſentations</hi> of what Chriſt doth in us, and that could Print, That when God hath glutted himſelf, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (as in the Book): For your Zeal to God's Glory in which, may you have an Eternal Reward above, and many good days of God's Bleſſing here, is my Supplication to the Throne of Grace. But beſides theſe <hi>Dragons</hi> againſt the Chriſtian Religion, which you have been quelling, we have the <hi>Foxes</hi> running about that ſpoil the Vines; thoſe that under the fair Species of Man's Holineſs, would undermine God's Righteouſneſs in our Juſtification: <hi>For going about to eſtabliſh their own Righteouſneſs, they have not ſubmitted to the Righteouſneſs of God,</hi> Rom. <hi>10.3.</hi> That is, they are againſt being juſtified freely by his Grace, through the Redemption that is in Jeſus, againſt having his Righteouſneſs imputed to them, to be unto, and upon, all that believe, though the Scripture is clear herein. But beſides the pure Word of God, which is the Sheet-Anchor of our Religion, it is a great Mercy that in Diſputes, with Men of corrupt Minds, that we have the Fundamentals of Chriſtianity contained in the Doctrines eſtabliſhed by Law, in the Book of the <hi>Homilies,</hi> wherewith to incounter ſuch Foxes as would ſpoil our tender Grapes, by denying our very Sins to be born by Chriſt, and bringing in ſome degrees of our Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, though imperfect, to joyn, as it were, with Chriſt's Righteouſneſs for our Juſtification, and to make ſuch our Obedience paſs currant, by bringing in God making a Law that in effect allows of Sin, which are excepted againſt in the enſuing Treatiſe; which I put forth to vindicate, according to my poor Talent, not ſo much Dr. <hi>Criſp,</hi> but the Doctrine
<pb facs="tcp:41406:3"/> of God our Saviour, delivered by the Doctor conſonantly to the Sacred Scriptures, and to the ſaid <hi>Homilies,</hi> as you may perceive, upon peruſal of theſe my Collections, from Scripture and ſound Authors: Which I humbly recommend to your leiſurely ſerious Conſiderations, hoping you will think it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, in this degenerate Age, to contend for the Faith deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to the Saints; and that your ſelves, ſo many of you as ſhall be choſen for the next Parliament, (which I ſuppoſe will not be a few), that you will think it worthy your Pains and Labour to indeavour to ſuppreſs all <hi>Socinian</hi> and <hi>Arminian</hi> Tenets, that, to uphold Man's <hi>Free Will</hi> to do good, ſtrike at our being ſaved <hi>freely</hi> by God's Grace, contrary to God's Word; <hi>We are ſaved by Grace through Faith; and that not of our ſelves, it is the Gift of God: Not of Works, leſt any boaſt.</hi> Our Holy Fore-Fathers, in the Nations ſhaking off the Popiſh Yoke, ſpake plainly, <hi>We in Chriſt paid the Debt: We in him are fulfillers of the Law: He on his Croſs made a perfect cleanſing of thy Sins.</hi> But this will not go down with Arminianizers of this day, that bring in our Goſpel-Holineſs to concur with Chriſt's Righteouſneſs in our Juſtification. This I addreſs to your Pious Thoughts; and, I ſuppoſe, not improperly to you, as expected Members of the Houſe of Commons, hoping the next Parliament may begin where the laſt left off, in taking Care of the True Chriſtian Religion: And that you may be the better fortified, I quote a Vote of a former Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, <hi>March 2. 1628. Whoſoever ſhall bring in Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of Religion, or by Favour, or Countenance, ſeem to extend</hi> Popery <hi>or</hi> Arminianiſm, <hi>or other Opinion, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeing from the Truth and Orthodox Church, ſhall be reputed a Capital Enemy to the Kingdom and Common-Wealth.</hi> VVhich Spirit, againſt <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Arminianiſm,</hi> through the great Mercy of God to this Nation, hath been kept alive and warm in all Parliaments ſince <hi>1628,</hi> even in
<pb facs="tcp:41406:4"/> the Reign of King <hi>James</hi> the Second; and there is no doubt of loſing it in this Reign, wherein His Majeſty hath given good Proof that he is neither <hi>Papiſt</hi> nor <hi>Arminian,</hi> nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining thereto. Now whether the Quotations, in this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, do not ſhew, that ſome mentioned therein go againſt the Orthodox Church, judge ye, and the Lord give you VViſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to withſtand. Thus hoping for a favourable Conſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of my Endeavour, <hi>pro modulo ſi non pro voto,</hi> to vindicate the Truths of the Goſpel, I beg the Lord's Bleſſing on you, and am,</p>

I hope, e're this, God hath cauſed you often to mourn over your intemperate Management of your <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke;</hi> and leſt you ſhould come ſhort therein, that I may provoke you ſeriouſly thereto, I think it neceſſary to lay before you the Character, I had lately from a Worthy Miniſter of the Goſpel, and Friend of yours, concerning him you have ſo unmercifully traduced, which was given by one that, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in the height of his Zeal, was as bitter as any againſt Dr. <hi>Criſp,</hi> except your ſelf; that is, by Mr. <hi>Richard Baxter</hi> upon his Death-Bed but two days before he dyed, as this Friend of yours aſſured me, once and again, that Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> told him, and he related it to you very lately, as thus, that Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſaid to your Friend, <hi>There has been a great deal of Talk about Dr.</hi> Criſp, <hi>but I look upon him to have been a Godly, Holy Man, and that he was Sound and Orthodox, and that he brought in more Souls to Chriſt than any of us; but this was his Fault</hi> (ſaid Mr. <hi>Baxter) that being a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular Man, and mightily flock'd after, he would preach</hi> Extempore <hi>Sermons, which expoſed him to deliver Things undigeſted, which needed to be corrected, but for the
<pb facs="tcp:41406:5"/> main he was Sound and Orthodox.</hi> For which Teſtimony I thanking the Relater, deſired him to give me it in Writing in <hi>ipſiſſimis Verbis;</hi> but being prudent, he deſired Excuſe, and repeated the ſame again to me, and afterwards to others. I told him, as to the <hi>Extempore</hi> Sermons, that was a great Miſtake to my knowledge; and I was glad God had convinced ſo great an Enemy to the Doctor. Now if this be true, as there is not the leaſt grain of ground to doubt, it coming from a Faithful, Holy Miniſter, then ſurely Dr. <hi>Criſp</hi> was not ſuch an one as my <hi>Kratiſte</hi> hath blackned him to be, God ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving provided for the embalming his Memory with ſweet Odours, even from his gain-ſayers when launching into Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, to give an account of their hard Speeches unrepented of. I hope it may pleaſe the Lord, by his Holy Spirit ſtriking in with this and other Occurrences, to lower the top-ſails of my good Friend, before he brings you to the brink of Eternity, when your Natural Parts will ſignifie nothing; and that you may have more Time, than Mr. <hi>B</hi> — had, to teſtifie to the World your high prizing the Free Grace of God in Chriſt, as held out by many beſides Dr. <hi>Criſp,</hi> as in the enſuing Treatiſe; and that you may teſtifie to the World alſo, that your Father in Law, Mr. <hi>King,</hi> miſtook in his Propheſie, ſaying, (as I am told) <hi>That his Son in Law</hi> (your ſelf) <hi>had good Parts, but his Pride would undo him.</hi> But I hope, and pray, the contrary, <hi>viz.</hi> That God would undo him only of Natural ſelf, and do him up again by the renewing of the Spirit.

               <p>From this bluſtering Porch let us ſee if we may find better Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the Houſe, though ſome Men find the worſt Storms within doors; I come therefore to Page the 5th of the <hi>Rebuke,</hi> where he ſaith the Reporter has left out <hi>New Obedience and Good Works,</hi> out of the account he gives of the <hi>Subſtance</hi> of the Goſpel; and then by way of a ſmiling Banter, he ſaith the Reporter ſaid, <hi>The Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Goſpel lyes in what Chriſt ſuffered for them.</hi> This he ſeems to diſallow; which I look on with a ſad Eye: For if what Chriſt hath done for us, (all his Life as well as his Death being his Suffering); if this be not the Subſtance of the Goſpel, what will become of us? If the Rebuker conſults <hi>Luke</hi> 2.10. he will find that our <hi>New Obedience and Good Works</hi> are not the Subſtance of the Goſpel, but that <hi>to us is born a Saviour.</hi> The Angel tells the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Goſpel there; I <hi>evangelize</hi> to you great Joy, which ſhall be to all People; for to you is born this day a Saviour, Chriſt the Lord. <hi>Evangelizomai,</hi> I <hi>Goſpelize</hi> this to you. Here we ſee what the Goſpel is; it is glad Tidings. And what is this glad Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings? It is that Chriſt, a Saviour, was born. Here's not one word of <hi>New Obedience</hi> or our <hi>Good Works,</hi> to be part of the Subſtance of the Goſpel; they come in as Fruits of the Spirit upon receiving the Goſpel; but are no more the Subſtance of the Goſpel, than the Holy Law of God is the Subſtance of the Goſpel: <hi>But the Law came by Moſes, and Grace and Truth by Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Surely the Spirit of God knew better how to give an account of the Goſpel, what it is, than any he calls, <hi>We poor Presbyterians:</hi> And for any to jeer at Chriſt's Sufferings for us, for its being called the Subſtance of the Goſpel, it may trouble their Conſciences one day, when they ſhall be forc'd to fly to that as their <hi>tutiſſimum eſt,</hi> as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> did, though ſome think too late. O! how ſhould we have a Care that our Wit do not put us on jeſting with the Goſpel; which in its diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering Chriſt to be all in all to us, our Wiſdom, Righteouſneſs,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:41406:7"/> Sanctification and Redemption, is the Power of God to Salvation. We ſhould conſider what the Apoſtle counted the Subſtance of the Goſpel, when he ſaid, <hi>I determined to know</hi> nothing <hi>among you but Chriſt, and him crucified.</hi> This was his great Study, Chriſt and his Sufferings, ſo it ſhould be ours.</p>

               <p>In Page 6. he ſaith, <hi>Give me my Bible again.</hi> This Jeſt may be returned with ſeriouſneſs, It is well he call'd for his Bible again, for he had ſpoke without Book ſadly before, in ſaying, <hi>Good Works are to come in in the Subſtance of the Goſpel.</hi> This 'tis for Men to ſpeak without the Bible, which alone, by the Spirit, makes wiſe to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: But I fear ſome ſad uſe he will make of his Bible; for it ſoon follows in the ſame Page, that which I grieve at, <hi>viz.</hi> his making a Jeſt of Chriſt's putting himſelf into our <hi>Place, State</hi> and <hi>Condition,</hi> which he jeers with the <hi>Socinian</hi> Retort; If ſo, <hi>then</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>Chriſt was deſtitute of a Righteouſneſs, and we too, to intitle us to Eternal Life.</hi> For Anſwer, If Chriſt was not in our Place, State and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, what's become of the Goſpel? We have loſt it, if the Juſt did not ſuffer for the Unjuſt, if the Lord did not lay on him the Iniquity of us all, if he was not the Man of Sorrows that bare our Griefs. Was he not in our Place, State and Condition, in all this? And to ſay that then he was deſtitute of a Righteouſneſs, is to deny his being God-Man; or not to diſtinguiſh between his being Perfect in himſelf, and ſo holy, harmleſs, ſeparate from Sinners, and his being made Sin and a Curſe for us, as being our Repreſentative. Methinks thoſe that call themſelves <hi>Poor Presbyterians,</hi> ſhould not ſo coaleſce with the <hi>Socinians</hi> to enforce ſuch a Conſequence from Chriſts being our Surety, as the <hi>Socinians</hi> do to ſay, <hi>That if Chriſt ſtood in our Place, then he wanted a Righteouſneſs in himſelf.</hi> You may as well ſay, that Chriſt was not made Righteouſneſs to us, if he was made Sin for us: how could he be both? Very well. He was made our Righteouſneſs, as we having his compleat God-like, yea, God's Righteouſneſs; as it was his Righteouſneſs the Son of God imputed to us, ſo he was made Righteouſneſs to us; and he was made Sin for us, by the Lord's imputing and laying our Sins on him, and yet he, though made Sin, was ſtill the moſt holy Son of God, without Sin in him.</p>

               <p>In the next Aſſault, he inſults over the Reporter, for ſaying, <hi>we are Sin.</hi> What though that very word is not in the Text? What is it leſs, to be <hi>ſinful,</hi> to be <hi>ſold under Sin, conceived in Sin,</hi> yea, to be <hi>a Body of Sin?</hi> But the fling is againſt the Change; Chriſt's being made Sin and a Curſe, and we thereby delivered from Sin and the Curſe. Suppoſe Man is not ſaid in Scripture to be Sin, Sin it ſelf, and that that is a debaſing Man below, being born in Sin, and having a Body of Sin, will you find fault with him, or any, for leſſening of Man ſo; whereas Chriſt is far more leſſened? For it is ſaid poſitively, God made him to be <hi>Sin</hi> for us; and that no Man can have the Face to deny that owns Revealed Religion. But many will ſo <hi>mince</hi> his being made Sin for us, that at laſt it ſhall be like ſome Minc'd Pyes, that ſhall not taſte a jot of the Meat in them: They ſay in words, he was made Sin; but they diſtinguiſh away every bit of the Sin, and ſay, Chriſt only bore the <hi>Puniſhment</hi> due to Sin. As if God ſhould be ſo Unjuſt, as to puniſh Chriſt for Sin, when no Sin was upon him. If Chriſt our Lord, in being made Sin for us, had not our very Sins laid on him by God, and borne by himſelf on the Tree, why was he puniſhed? Will you make God Unrighteous, to lay Sin upon him, to bruiſe him for our Iniquities, and theſe very Sins and Iniquities not made his, or accounted his by Imputation?</p>

               <p>The great Objection comes in Page 9. about the <hi>Change of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi> between Chriſt and Sinners. The Rebuker owns there was a Change of Chriſt for Sinners, but denies that Chriſt took the Perſon of Sinners: But if we read <hi>John</hi> 17. there we may find for our Comfort, in Chriſt's Prayer, Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Thine they were, thou gaveſt them me, and I am glorified</hi> in <hi>them, that they may be one</hi> in <hi>us.</hi> Is not this taking their Perſons into Oneneſs with himſelf? And <hi>v.</hi> 23. <hi>I</hi> in <hi>them, and thou</hi> in <hi>me, that the World may know that thou haſt loved them as thou haſt loved me.</hi> And how can we be ſaid to be Crucified <hi>with</hi> Chriſt, to be Buried <hi>with</hi> him, Riſen <hi>with</hi> him, if he took not our Perſons? <hi>He hath made us ſit in Heavenly places</hi> in <hi>Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> It is not ſaid only <hi>with</hi> him; but <hi>in</hi> him. Surely then Chriſt hath taken the Perſons of Elect Sinners into himſelf; and to deny this, looks like denying being choſen in him from all Eternity, and real Union to him, and Incorporation in him in time.</p>

               <p>In Page 10. the Rebuker ſeems to ſwerve very much from the Orthodox, in his oppoſing the Terms laid down, and contradicts them very Dogmatically; and in the place of that which he calls the Reporters Terms of Art, he gives us his Senſe concerning the Change of Perſons, <hi>All that the Caſe of Sinners required for Satisfaction to Divine Juſtice, was a Subſtitute or Sacrifice to be offered for our Sins; for the Subſtitute to take on him the P<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>NISHMENT due to them:</hi> (That's all he allows, not the Sins, not the Guilt, not the Offence, only Puniſhment, that's all that Juſtice requires) <hi>But to take on him the Perſon of Sinners, as the Phraſe is new and uncouth, ſo it's to me unintelligible, till they who have invented it ſhall interpret it.</hi> O! that Men were wiſe to Sobriety, and not in effect to tax the Holy God with ſpeaking uncouth, new, unintelligible Things. 'Tis evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently not true, that the Term is <hi>new,</hi> how uncouth or unintelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſoever it may be to ſome who will repel Scripture Truths. Will
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:41406:8"/> any pretend to teach the Moſt High how to ſpeak of our Sins laid on Chriſt, by ſaying, he only bare the <hi>Puniſhment</hi> due to them, and that's <hi>all</hi> that our Caſe required? God ſaith expreſly, <hi>The Lord laid on him</hi> the iniquity <hi>of us all; and he ſhall bear</hi> their iniquities. Their very Iniquities it was: And he bare their Sins iii his own Body on the Tree. <hi>Our very Sins, our very Iniquities.</hi> And is all this dwin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled to nothing but the Puniſhment due to them? Bearing Sin is in Deed and Truth, if God ſay true, bearing Sin, 'tis not bearing Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, that follows bearing Sin. Bearing Puniſhment is a word <hi>invented</hi> to nullifie Chriſt's bearing our Sins, and ſo to evacuate the Goſpel: For if Chriſt bare not the Sins as well as the Puniſhment, the Sins muſt lye on the Sinner to all Eternity. For Sin being once committed, muſt be born by us, or our Surety. I can find but lew Texts where Chriſt is ſaid to bear Puniſhment due to Sin; but through Infinite Rich Grace, many Texts of Divine Truth ſhew that he bare Sins, and did them away. In bearing the Chaſtiſement of our peace, he bare our very Sorrows and Griefs, which is more than bare Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment due for Sin.</p>

               <p>But this is <hi>new, uncouth</hi> and <hi>unintelligible,</hi> that Chriſt ſhould take on him the Perſon of Sinners, <hi>till they interpret it, who invented it.</hi> For this we may raiſe the Dead, without a Miracle, to prove the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, though not the Invention of it (that being Time out of mind.)

                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:41406:9"/> be true, That Chriſt bare only the Puniſhment due for Sins, that he did not bear the Sins, the very Sins, the very Iniquities of his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Now ſaith this Doctor, he was ſo far from not bearing their very Sins, that he bare their Perſons; which ſurely muſt include their Sins, and all the horrid Appurtenances belonging to them.

I live, not I but Chriſt in me; I ſin, not I but Sin that dwells in me; and we were planted in the likeneſs of his Death, <hi>our Old Man crucified;</hi> when? <hi>With Chriſt; we are dead to the Law;</hi> how? <hi>By the Body of Chriſt.</hi> What Nonſenſe and puzzling Stuff is this to the Natural Underſtanding?

Surely no otherwiſe than he was choſen in Chriſt from all Eternity, by Chriſt's being the Repreſentative of all the Elect from all Eternity, and as he ſuſtained all their Perſons in time when he hung on the Tree. And this though uncouth to the wiſe and prudent of this World, is couth and of a raviſhing ſweetneſs to thoſe that taſte this Grace of our Lord Jeſus; and owned by Mr. <hi>Alſop</hi> in <hi>Antiſozzo,</hi> p. 376. <hi>Duos Populos in ſe ſuſcepit Chriſtus.</hi> Ambroſe.

Sure the Brethren that united in 1691, had Time ſufficient to digeſt the Doctors Sermons in Two Years time: And it appears by that Union, ſo long after, that theſe Sermons could not indamage the good Correſpondence between the Brethren. If they had been Reprinted in 1692, this Argument might have ſome weight. But it is manifeſt rather, that Mr. <hi>Williams,</hi> and they who ſet him a work, had a Mind to break the Union; which they effectually accompliſhed, by letting fly ſo hotly againſt the Truths of the Goſpel, aſſerted in thoſe Sermons: For they knew well, that moſt of the Congregational Brethren held with Doctor <hi>Criſp</hi> in many Things, called Errors in Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> his <hi>Goſpel-Truth</hi> (mis) <hi>ſtated.</hi> So that the Rebuker's aſſigning thoſe Sermons, a Reaſon of Suſpicion, is brought in by Head and Shoulders, to cover Mr. <hi>Williams</hi>'s Head from the Charge of breaking the Union, by his ſo formidably treating thoſe Sermons, and therein the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourers of them, ſuch as the Reverend Mr. <hi>Cole,</hi> Mr. <hi>Mather,</hi> and many others.</p>

               <p>In Page 23, the Rebuker brings in the Diſſenting Brethren, called upon by the United ones, to renounce ſome odd Notions, as he calls them; the third of which I note, it being, <hi>That any are in the ſight of God juſtified, or intituled to Eternal Life, before they are effectually called,</hi> &amp;c. This is to be renounc'd as a <hi>Criſpian Heterodoxy,</hi> though countenanced by Men of greater Name than Dr. <hi>Criſp.</hi> If known to God are all his Works from Everlaſting, which the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buker cannot deny, then <hi>in the ſight of God,</hi> all are Juſtified from all Eternity, I ſay, <hi>in God's ſight,</hi> that are not actually Juſtified in their own Perſons, till united to Chriſt by Faith. But beſides, that ſort of Juſtification of the Elect, <hi>in God's ſight,</hi> from Eternity, there are ſeveral Scriptures which import that which is tantamount to Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification of the Elect actually, though not perſonally, <hi>in God's ſight,</hi> from Eternity, as <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.3. <hi>Yea, I have loved thee with an Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Love:</hi> Which Everlaſting Love, all agree, is as well from Eternity paſt, as to Eternity to come; and if loved from Eternity, what is that ſhort of being then juſtified? For God loved them as he ſaw them in Chriſt undertaken for to be juſtified by his Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: But that which goes higher, they were the Delight of Chriſt from all Eternity; <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.26, 30, 31. <hi>While as yet he had not made the Earth— I was by him, as one brought up with him; I was dayly his Delights, and my Delights were with the Sons of Men.</hi> Here was the high Effect of Eternal Love, Jeſus Chriſt, the Wiſdom of the Father, he from all Eternity, and in all Eternity, he was the Delights of the Father; and during the ſame Eternity, the Son's Delights were with, or in, the Elect given him of the Father; <hi>Thine
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:41406:12" rendition="simple:additions"/> they were, and thou gaveſt them me.</hi> So that there was an Eternal Complacency in the Lord Jeſus, in and to all that he was to redeem, by laying down his Life; and if ſo, did not he delight in them, as having Grace given to them in Chriſt before the World was? And ſo he looks on them as Redeemed, as Juſtified, and as Sanctified by him; though it was not actually accompliſhed in their Perſons, yet it was actually concluded between the Father and Son, in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of Peace, <hi>Zach.</hi> 6.13. and God thereupon took Chriſt's Word, or Covenant, for it, as if it were actually done, upon which account <hi>Abraham,</hi> and all the Old Teſtament Believers, were juſtified and ſaved before Chriſt had actually paid the Ranſome for many. Thus being undertaken for by Chriſt from Eternity, they were lookt on by God as having a <hi>repreſentative being</hi> in Chriſt from all Eternity, when choſen in him, and Grace given them in him from all Eternity in 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.9. And this our Repreſentative being from all Eternity in Chriſt, even Mr. <hi>Clark</hi> himſelf, in his Notes on the Bible, was forc d to allow. Therefore to renounce abſolutely that the Elect are juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied <hi>in the ſight of God,</hi> before their effectual calling, is to bear hard on thoſe Scriptures that declare God's Everlaſting Love to them, and Chriſt's Delight in them, from all Eternity, and Grace given them in Chriſt before they are effectually called; of which ſee Mr. <hi>Pemble,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Twiſs,</hi> by and by.</p>

<pb n="17" facs="tcp:41406:13"/> of the 21, how formidable then muſt the following 20 be, if this <hi>Man of Straw</hi> muſt lead the Van, that 'tis an Hereſie to ſay, <hi>a Goſpel-Threat is a Bull.</hi> But leaving this Moon calf,</p>

               <p>His ſecond Hereſie is, <hi>That Pardon is rather the Condition of Faith, than Faith is of Pardon.</hi> That is to ſay, That Faith rather flows from Pardon, than Pardon from Faith; and for any to ſay ſo, is with him an <hi>Antinomian</hi> Hereſie; which is a ſtrange Strain, for the Scripture ſaith, <hi>We are juſtified freely by his Grace;</hi> which Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion includes Pardon; then we are <hi>Pardoned</hi> freely by his Grace, <hi>not of Works, leſt any boaſt;</hi> if ſo, then we are not pardoned upon account of Faith, as a Condition of it, but upon account of Chriſt's Blood waſhing away our Sins, which is called the Righteouſneſs of God, and this is received by Faith: but Chriſt, with this Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of his, firſt receives or apprehends us; and then being ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended by him, we, by his Spirit, are enabled to apprehend him by Faith; and ſo the Righteouſneſs of God is <hi>revealed from Faith to Faith.</hi> The Apoſtle doth not ſay, the Righteouſneſs of God (wherein our Pardon is included) that this is <hi>made ours by Faith,</hi> or that Faith is the <hi>Condition</hi> of our having it; but Faith is that <hi>whereto it is revealed</hi> to us: It was given to us before when Chriſt firſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended us, but it is <hi>Revealed,</hi> made manifeſt to us, that it is ours by Faith wrought in us, and more and more <hi>Revealed</hi> as Faith in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſes, it being <hi>revealed from Faith to Faith,</hi> mark it is <hi>to</hi> Faith. So that this Hereſie amounts to no more than this, as for a Perſon to ſay, That Chriſt (and Pardon with him) firſt takes hold of us, is the Root of an endleſs Life in us, and ſo works Faith in us: This with you is Hereſie, but with us ſound Truth, elſe we ſhould never have either Pardon or Faith; and <hi>this we muſt averr,</hi> rather than to ſay, that Faith is the Condition, or Root or Principle, from which our Pardon flows or grows, becauſe to call Faith a Condition of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, any other way, than as it is an Eye that Pardon is revealed <hi>to,</hi> and an Hand that receives a Pardon firſt given, is to make Faith a Co-partner with Chriſt's Blood, and God's Free Grace, which muſt not be aſſerted.</p>

               <p>His third Hereſie to be renounc'd, I think, is as Ridiculous as the firſt, and that is this, 'Tis a Hereſie to ſay, <hi>It was Sin as to the Anomia that Chriſt bore; The Fault of Sin was laid on Chriſt.</hi> That is, with them Chriſt did not beare the <hi>Anomia,</hi> the Iniquity of Sin, and Chriſt did not beare the <hi>Fault</hi> of Sin, that is to ſay, with the <hi>Neonomians</hi> Chriſt bore Sin without the <hi>Anomia</hi> of it, or Chriſt bore Sin without the <hi>Fault</hi> of it; which is the ſame as to ſay, Chriſt bore <hi>Sinleſs Sin</hi> and <hi>Faultleſs Sin;</hi> which is, beſides its being a Catachreſis, or Bull to bear <hi>Faultleſs Sin,</hi> 'tis a total Overthrow of the whole Goſpel, and of all our Salvation by Chriſt's Sufferings; for if Chriſt bare only <hi>Faultleſs Sin,</hi> then he bare only the Puniſhment, and that very Unrighteouſly too, and left the Fault for us to do away as well as we can, with Tears of Repentance, and with our New Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, which will never waſh our <hi>Black-a-moor</hi> Souls White, or elſe we muſt beare the Fault to all Eternity, for nothing can waſh away the Stain and Pollution but the Blood of Chriſt: But by their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine Chriſt hath not done away the <hi>Anomia,</hi> nor borne the <hi>Fault.</hi> But in plain <hi>Engliſh,</hi> I muſt ſay to my Dear <hi>Kratiſte,</hi> and all his Friends, that vent and vend ſuch Doctrine, It looks very Boldly and Affront<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, to teach the Holy God to ſpeak; He ſaith over and over in the Old and New Teſtament, that Chriſt bare our Iniquity, our Tranſgreſſion, our Sins; he bare our <hi>Sins</hi> in his Body, he hath done away <hi>Sin</hi> by the Sacrifice of himſelf, he bare our <hi>Sins,</hi> our very Sins, without any diſtinction of <hi>Puniſhment, Guilt, Stain, Fault</hi> or <hi>Filth;</hi> he bare our Sin, and for theſe Gentlemen to talk of bearing Sin with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Fault, or to talk of Faultleſs Sin, how bold a Stroke at the Root of the Goſpel is this, and how dreadful a Thought muſt this make, in all that come to God for Pardon through the Blood of Chriſt, to hear it aſſerted by the great Goſpel-Staters, that Chriſt bare <hi>Sin,</hi> 'tis true, but he left the <hi>Fault</hi> for the Sinner to waſh off by his Holy Life, and to do otherwiſe they call <hi>Antinomian</hi> Hereſie. But for Argument, If Sin be laid on Chriſt without the Fault, then 'tis no Sin, for what is Sin but the Tranſgreſſion of the Law? And what is that but Fault? And beſides, this is to make God infinitely <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>njuſt,</hi> and alſo <hi>Cruel</hi> to our Lord Jeſus, his Dear and Only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten Son, to inflict the Heavy Dreadful Puniſhment which was laid
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:41406:14"/> on him for Sin, when this Sin, as to the Fault that deſerved the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, was not laid or charged on him: So that Chriſt was by ſuch Doctrine puniſhed where no Fault was charged: From ſuch Doctrine the Good Lord deliver all that deſire Salvation by and through our Lord Jeſus: This is ſtrange Doctrine, to tell us of Fault<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Sin borne by Chriſt: But it is the ſame ſort of Divinity as a <hi>Goſpel-Threat,</hi> or a <hi>Glad-Tyding-Threat;</hi> firſt we have Goſpel Threat, that's our New Goſpel; and now comes Faultleſs Sin, and that's the Curſe that Chriſt bore. But by the way, there could be no <hi>Curſe</hi> in Chriſt's Sufferings, if he did not beare the <hi>Fault</hi> as well as the <hi>Puniſhment:</hi> But Bleſſed be God our Good Old Bibles have no ſuch Language in them, but tell us plainly he bare our <hi>Sins,</hi> our very <hi>Sins, and hath waſhed us from our Sins</hi> (that is, from all the <hi>Fault, Stain</hi> and <hi>Pollution) in his Blood.</hi> Therefore leaving this Idle Hereſie, let us ever adore him that hath done away our Sins, our very Sins, all that appertains to them, by the Sacrifice of himſelf, to whom be Glory for ever and ever.</p>

               <p>He proceeds to aggravate this third <hi>Antinomian</hi> Hereſie, as he calls it, and ſaith, 'tis Hereſie to ſay, <hi>Chriſt was reputed a Criminal, not only by Man, but by God.</hi> This is the more ſtrange, becauſe my Dear <hi>Kratiſte,</hi> the Rebuker, owns that Chriſt ſuffered, <hi>loco noſtro, vice noſtra,</hi> in our place, in our ſtead. And how this could be, and he not a reputed Criminal, is a Paradox, unleſs he means in our place was no more than as the <hi>Socinians</hi> ſay, for <hi>our good only;</hi> 'tis true, this he is charged with, and he gives but too much occaſion for it, but I cannot believe he excludes Chriſt in his Suffering, making Satisfaction to God in our ſtead, and his bearing away our Sins by his Suffering, and imputing his own Righteouſneſs to us for our Good. But whatever he grants, here we ſee he brings in this Clauſe, of Chriſt being <hi>reputed</hi> a Criminal by God, to be one of thoſe which he calls <hi>Abominable Doctrines.</hi> In the ſame page 25. <hi>Which if not Antidoted againſt</hi> (he ſaith) <hi>will prove a Bane and Poyſon to the Soul.</hi> O whither is my <hi>Kratiſte</hi> driven in the Hurricane of his diſturbed Zeal for Mr. <hi>Williams.</hi> Could Chriſt beare our Sins, and be puniſhed for our Sins, even to that Extremity, as to cry, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me:</hi> Could the Juſt ſuffer Juſtly
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:41406:15" rendition="simple:additions"/> for the Unjuſt, and not be a <hi>reputed Criminal?</hi> What ſhall we make of the Juſtice of God, to ſay, <hi>Awake, O Sword, againſt the Man that is my Fellow:</hi> If this Fellow of God, this Bleſſed Holy Spotleſs Lamb of God, had not the Sins of his People ſo charged on him, that he was look'd on as a reputed Criminal, ſtanding in their place, with all their Sins laid on him; and ſo though he was not a Criminal in the leaſt <hi>actively,</hi> yet he was look'd upon by God as a Criminal <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentatively,</hi> in their ſtead whoſe Crimes and Sins he bore. This is the General Argument of all the Orthodox, How could God juſtly puniſh him, if he was not a <hi>reputed</hi> Criminal, as ſtanding a Surety for us? What was Imputed to him, if not our Sin, when he bare our Sins, and cryed out, <hi>My Soul is exceeding Sorrowful to Death?</hi> But to be plain, it appears our Lord Jeſus was a <hi>reputed</hi> Criminal, when Innocent to Perfection in himſelf, in that he owns all the Sins of Believers to be <hi>his Sins,</hi> as in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40.7. compared with the 12th Verſe, he ſaith, <hi>Lo, I come to do thy will, O God:</hi> Then it follows, <hi>Mine Iniquities have taken hold of me, ſo that I am not able to look up: They are more than the hairs of mine head.</hi> This is ſpoken by our Lord Jeſus, as is plain in <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.9. here he owns they are <hi>his</hi> Iniquities; How were they <hi>his?</hi> but as he ſuſtained the Perſons of all the Elect, and ſo was a <hi>reputed</hi> Criminal in their ſtead, and their Sins being by the Lord laid on him, he takes them on himſelf as his <hi>own</hi> Iniquities, and ſaith, They are more than the Hairs of his Head. And again, in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 69.4, 5. Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Then I reſtored that which I took not away, O God, thou knoweſt my Fooliſhneſs, and my Sins are not hid from thee.</hi> Then it follows, <hi>The Zeal of thine Houſe hath eaten me up:</hi> Which is plain of Chriſt. So that our <hi>Fooliſhneſs and Sins</hi> being laid on him, he calls them <hi>his,</hi> and ſaith <hi>right,</hi> for they were <hi>really</hi> his, though but by Imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as a Debt is really a <hi>Sureties,</hi> though he be but a Surety, yet that's enough, and ſo our Lord Jeſus found it, when he was in his Agony, Sweating clodders of Blood, and on the Croſs, crying, <hi>My God, why,</hi> &amp;c. ſure he did not cry out ſo terribly for faultleſs Sin, but as a reputed Criminal for real Sin laid on him.</p>

                  <q>Remiſſio enim peccatorum ſi <hi>Quidditatem</hi> inſpicias nihil aliud eſt quam aut punitionis negatio aut volitionis puniendi negatio, ſit ergo peccata remittere nihil aliud quam nolle punire, at hoc nolle punire ut actus immanens in Deo fuit ab aeterno, nec fidem conſequitur nec Spiritus Sancti operatione in nobis terminare deprehenditur, Quod vero operatione Spiritus Sancti nobis hac parte per fidem contingit aliud eſſe non poterat quam SENS<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S Gratiae Dei.

<q>What is that Forgiveneſs of Sins which follows Faith?</q>

               <p>Which he anſwers thus:
<q>Forgiveneſs of Sins, if you conſider the <hi>Quiddity</hi> (or Eſſence) of it, is nothing elſe but either a denying of Puniſhment, or deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Will to puniſh: Therefore to remit or forgive Sins, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but not to will to puniſh.

               <p>His fifth Hereſie he charges, as <hi>Antinomian,</hi> is, that <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion to Chriſt is before Faith, at leaſt</hi> Naturâ, <hi>and we partake of the Spirit by vertue of that <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion.</hi> It is to admiration that this firm ſolid Truth ſhould be called Hereſie. Can any thing be more clear, than that Faith is a <hi>Fruit</hi> of Union to Chriſt, unleſs it be a dead Faith? <hi>Can a Branch bring out Grapes before it is united to the Vine, Chriſt Jeſus?</hi> Doth he not ſay, <hi>Without me you can do nothing?</hi> I would ask, whence can a living Faith come, but from <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> to Jeſus Chriſt? Can it ſpring out of corrupt Nature, and ſo bring us to Chriſt? A dead Branch may be tyed to the Vine, but a living Branch grows out of the Vine. The Apoſtle was of the mind, that Chriſt firſt takes hold of us, before we can, by Faith, take hold of him; according to <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.12. <hi>I follow after, if that I may apprehend that for which I am alſo apprehended of Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> Here he was firſt apprehended of Chriſt, as Dr. <hi>Manton</hi> told us well at <hi>Pinners-Hall,</hi> and from thence infer'd, (as well he might) that all that partake of Chriſt are firſt apprehended of him, and ſo he unites himſelf to them before they can act Faith on him, which is their apprehending him. They muſt make Chriſtians to be <hi>Monſters,</hi> that make them to live as Members of Chriſt by Faith, before they are united to him. How can a Man poſſibly, that is <hi>dead</hi> in Sins by Nature, come to believe in Chriſt, unleſs Chriſt comes firſt and <hi>quickens</hi> him, by uniting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the Soul? Hence the Apoſtle ſaid, <hi>It pleaſed God to reveal his
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:41406:16"/> Son in me,</hi> Gal. 1.16. Till then he was a zealous perſecuting <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſee,</hi> and could have not only called all Chriſt's Diſciples <hi>Antinomians,</hi> but have ſlaughtered them too, as ſome now ſlay their Names; but when Chriſt took hold of him, and God revealed his Son in him, then he conferred not with Fleſh and Blood, but in the way that <hi>they counted Hereſie, he worſhipped the God of his Fathers;</hi> believing what is written, <hi>Acts</hi> 24.14. The ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> is the <hi>quickening Spirit,</hi> and quickens all his Seed before they can live: <hi>You who were dead in Sins hath he quickned.</hi> Sure here was Union of Chriſt to them, thereby quickening them when dead in Sins, before they could put forth any living Act of Faith in him; or elſe we muſt feign, that a Believer hath a Spiritual Life in him, that is not from Chriſt, if he have Faith before he is united to Chriſt, as ſome pretend; and ſo there would be two Spiritual Lives in a Believer, one before Union to Chriſt, which works Faith, and the other from Chriſt upon act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our Faith: But this <hi>Aſs</hi> of our own Spiritual Life, and the <hi>Oxe</hi> of Chriſt's Life in us, will not draw well together. So that I think, I may ſafely conclude, this is no Hereſie to ſay, that Union to Chriſt is before Faith; much leſs is that which follows an Hereſie to ſay, <hi>that we partake of the Spirit by vertue of that <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion.</hi> This is brought in as part of the fifth Hereſie. Whence do the Branches partake of the Sap of the Vine, but from the Root, by Vertue of Union to the Vine? 'Tis ſtrange to admiration, that this ſhould be queſtion'd by thoſe who, like <hi>Peter,</hi> ſeem to be Pillars in the Church, to call it an <hi>Antinomian Hereſie</hi> to ſay, <hi>We partake of the Spirit, by vertue of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion to Chriſt.</hi> If the Spirit be not in us before Faith, how can he convince of Sin in not believing, and thereby work Faith? Doth not the Scripture ſay plainly, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.8, 9. <hi>To one is given, by the Spirit, the word of Wiſdom, to another Faith by the ſame Spirit?</hi> Doth the Spirit give Faith, and is he not then in the Soul to work Faith before it is wrought? Is not the <hi>Former</hi> before the Thing <hi>formed?</hi> If ſo, then ſure my Dear <hi>Kratiſte</hi> was in a great Miſtake, and has ſadly impoſed on thoſe that profeſs Faith in our Lord Jeſus, to rank this for a Hereſie, <hi>That we partake of the Spirit by vertue of our <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion to Chriſt, which in</hi> Naturâ <hi>is before Faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſixth, as being much akin to the former, I paſs only with the naming of it. 'Tis Hereſie, he ſaith, to ſay, <hi>Juſtification, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of Application, muſt be before Believing.</hi> Whoſe Saying this is, or whence it is taken, I know not: If the meaning be, that God
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:41406:17" rendition="simple:additions"/> applies it to us, or reckons it to us, before our Believing, that we are Juſtified: This is ſo far from Hereſie, that I think the contrary is a Contradiction: Or 'tis Nonſenſe for me to believe a Thing is mine, before it is given me, or applyed to me, and ſo made mine. And in that Senſe the Application of Juſtification, by God's Spirit, to my Conſcience, <hi>that God hath loved me, and given his Son for me;</hi> this muſt firſt be applyed to me before I can believe it, or elſe my Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving is but Preſumption. But if by Application of Juſtification before Believing, he means, that the Soul doth apply it to himſelf before his Believing, I think he is to ſeek for any that hold that Tenet.</p>

               <p>The eighth Hereſie is to aſſert, That <hi>we believe that we may be justified declaratively.</hi> The Caſe I take to be thus: The Apoſtle ſaith in <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.16. <hi>We believe that we may be juſtified by the Faith of Jeſus;</hi> from whence the <hi>Neonomians</hi> conclude, that the <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>credere,</hi> our Act of Faith, is that very Thing which juſtifies us, or that we are juſtified by our <hi>Work</hi> of Faith; if not by <hi>Works</hi> of Faith and Holineſs, (which ſometimes they joyn) yet at leaſt by a <hi>Work,</hi> by our Act of Believing: Whereas the Orthodox, according to the <hi>Homilies and Doctrine of the Church of</hi> England, from plain Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, put Faith it ſelf from us, as that Act that juſtifies, and ſay, Faith juſtifies only <hi>declaratively,</hi> as it manifeſts to the Conſcience our being juſtified by Chriſt's Blood, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.9. and freely by <hi>his</hi> Grace (not <hi>our</hi> Grace of Faith) through the Redemption that is in Jeſus. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.24. <hi>Titus</hi> 3.7. It is ſtill aſcribed to <hi>his</hi> Grace, not any Grace in us; our Grace of Faith being only the <hi>Inſtrument,</hi> or Hand, given us of God to receive Chriſt, and all in him. If Juſtification be as they would have it, from any Act of ours as the Ground or Cauſe of it, then we are not freely juſtified by <hi>his</hi> Grace, but by <hi>our Work</hi> of Believing; which, if not a <hi>Popiſh,</hi> is an <hi>Arminian</hi> Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net, to blemiſh the Free Grace of God in Jeſus Chriſt So that it may be ſafely concluded, that it is no Hereſie to ſay, our Juſtification by Faith is <hi>declarative,</hi> in as much as the <hi>Eſſence</hi> of Juſtification is by the Blood of Jeſus, and the Grace of God, imputing it to us, is the form of our Juſtification; which being received by Faith, is thereby manifeſted or declared to the Conſcience by the <hi>Illumination</hi> of the Holy Spirit, concurring with our Spirits therein.

               <p>The like ſort of Hereſie to this laſt, we find well ſpoken to by Famous <hi>Pemble,</hi> in his Treatiſe of <hi>Grace and Faith,</hi> in <hi>fol.</hi> 22, to prove God's being reconciled to the Elect before they believe, and ſo to take off the Clamour from Dr. <hi>Criſp;</hi> as if it were <hi>Antinomian Hereſie</hi> to ſay, we believe that we may be juſtified declaratively. Mr. <hi>Pemble</hi> argues ſolidly thus; <hi>Now that God doth actually love the Elect before they are regenerate, or can actually believe, may appear thus:</hi> (1.) <hi>Where God is actually reconciled he actually loves, but with the Elect, before they actually believe, God is actually reconciled; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he loves them before their Faith. The</hi> Minor <hi>is evident; becauſe, before they are born, a full Satisfaction and Atonement is made by Chriſt, and accepted on God's part, whereon actual Reconciliation muſt needs follow: He was the Lamb ſlain from the beginning of the World.</hi> (2.) <hi>If God did actually love the Elect before Chriſt's time, when an actual Reconciliation was not made, then much more may he actually love the Elect after the Atonement is really made by Chriſt's Death, even before they do believe it. The former is true by the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Patriarchs, therefore the latter may not well be denyed.</hi> (3.) <hi>Election, Vocation and Faith, are Fruits of God's Love to the Elect; which Graces he beſtows on them, becauſe he loves them.</hi> Now I argue; If God loved his Elect from Eternity, and this Love nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>increaſeth</hi> nor <hi>diminiſheth,</hi> as in God, as Mr. <hi>Pemble</hi> ſaith anon, then it is plain, that in the Righteous Judgment of God, <hi>foro Dei,</hi> there was never any Guilt on them, after they were delighted in by Chriſt: For God doth not take a Sinner by the Hand; that is the ſame as, he may be ſaid, not to love guilty Souls; but he doth take the Elect by the Hand from Eternity. As they are choſen in Chriſt from Eternity, ſo they were delighted in by Chriſt from Eternity; therefore the Elect, as Elect, are not guilty in the ſight of God: For if they were, how ſhould they be delighted in from Eternity, as having Grace given them in Chriſt, by the Father, from Eternity? 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.9. and <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.</p>

               <p>And now my hand is in with Mr. <hi>Pemble,</hi> and becauſe the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buker, and others, may, if the Lord pleaſe, ſee their Miſtake in their hard Cenſure on Dr. <hi>Criſp,</hi> and others, to ſay 'tis Heretical for them to ſay, <hi>That Juſtification is before Faith,</hi> I ſhall a little inlarge on this eighth Hereſie.

               <p>But Mr. <hi>Pemble</hi> goes farther in this Point, and ſaith, <q>That Faith doth not precede Participation with Chriſt, appears: (1) Our San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification wrought by the Spirit, conveys Life and Grace into our Souls when we are void of Faith, and before 'tis ask'd. (2.) Our Juſtification in God's ſight, which was long before we were born, is purchas'd for us by Chriſt: 'Tis vain to think, with the <hi>Arme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian,</hi> That Chriſt's Merits only made God PLACABILEM, not <hi>Placatum;</hi> no, the Ranſom is paid and accepted, all the Sins are actually pardoned; this grand Tranſaction between God, and the Mediator Jeſus Chriſt, was diſpatch'd in Heaven, before we had a Being; yet the Benefit of it was ours, and belonged to us at that time, though we never knew ſo much, till after that by Faith we apprehended it: As Lands may be ſettled on an Infant, though he knew nothing of it till he come of Age.</q> O! what clear Teſtimony is here, to convince the <hi>Neonomians,</hi> that beſides ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Scripture, thoſe that the Rebuker calls <hi>Antinomians,</hi> have very good Company going with them.</p>

               <p>Now we may no longer wonder to ſee ſuch Perſons Symbolize with, and be Champions for unſound Mr. <hi>Williams,</hi> who holds, That more than the Elect may be Saved; Witneſs theſe words of his by way of Scorn to his Oppoſers, in his Appendix to <hi>Goſpel Truth ſtated, It is not enough</hi> (ſaith Mr. <hi>Williams) that we own that Chriſt abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:41406:19"/> redeemed the Elect, ſo as to purchaſe ſaving Graces, as well as Benefits, to be infallibly theirs, unleſs we add, that all others are in ſtate of Devils, as having no real offers of Life on Goſpel terms: Nor is their Salvation poſſible if they will Repent and Believe.</hi> Here he holds it <hi>poſſible,</hi> that others, beſides the Elect, may Repent and Believe, and ſo their Salvation is poſſible. Nay herein <hi>Antiſozzo,</hi> whom my Dear <hi>Kratiſte</hi> hath a great value for, doth partly coaleſce in <hi>Page</hi> 103, ſaying, <hi>When God gave the Promiſe to the common Parent of Mankind, there was a poſſibility in the thing, that that means of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion might have been derived to all thoſe Rivulets into which his Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity ſhould be ſub-divided: If it was not, I conceive the Fault was theirs, not God's,</hi> (as if it would have been a Fault in God, if he did not give means for all to be Saved, when they had Damned themſelves.) Thus <hi>Antiſozzo</hi> has in a manner laid Salvation open in common, to Elect and Non-elect, to Veſſels before of old ordained to Condemnation, <hi>Jude</hi> 4. as well as to Veſſels of Mercy, for whom the Kingdom was prepared from the Foundation of the World, <hi>Matt.</hi> 25, directly contrary to the Confeſſion of the Aſſembly, which they both have Subſcribed, though I find not that they ever recanted this Expreſſion. The Aſſembly ſay, on the Point of God's Decree <hi>directly,</hi> that none but the Elect can be Saved thus, <hi>Theſe Angels and Men, their number is ſo certain and definite, that it cannot be increaſed or diminiſhed; neither are any other redeemed by Chriſt, effectually Called, Juſtified, Adopted, Sanctified and Saved, but the Elect only.</hi> For the proof of which, they quote 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.19. <hi>John</hi> 13.18. &amp; 17.9. &amp; 6.64, 65. &amp; 10.26. &amp; <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.28. <hi>I lay down my Life for the ſheep,</hi> and <hi>ye</hi> (Phariſees) <hi>ye believe not, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ye are not my ſheep.</hi> Thus theſe great Men have aſſerted, and this our <hi>Neonomians</hi> ſubſcribe to, in order to deceive the Simple, to believe they are Orthodox, when here 'tis viſible, how Heterodox theſe two great Contenders for the New Law are, plainly deviating from the Aſſembly, in allowing a <hi>Poſſibility</hi> for the Non elect to be Saved.

               <p>The Ninth and Tenth Hereſies are ſcarce worth mentioning, they being only ſome curtailed Expreſſions, that the Antagoniſts to the

               <p>Such another is his Tenth Hereſie, <hi>All that a Believer can pray for, is the farther Manifeſtation of Pardon; for he knows that all his Sins are pardoned.</hi> This is a manifeſt Breach of Charity, for he knows they pray for more; and though they may at ſome Seaſons, have full Aſſurance of being accepted in the Beloved Jeſus, wherein they ſee all their Sins were done away in his Blood, when he, to Sanctifie the People, Suffered without the Gate: Whereupon they, upon Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, cry, Glory to him who hath loved them, and waſhed them from their Sins with his Blood. Yet they daily pray for freſh Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries of the ſame, which, as to their Conſciences, is a Freſh Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, or renewing of Pardon. I hope my Dear <hi>Kratiſte</hi> will not deny, That by one Offering, he hath for ever perfected thoſe that are San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified; and that he Sanctified the People with his own Blood, when he Suffered without the Gate. If ſo, then all ſucceſſive Pardons, upon freſh Acts of Faith, are only the Clearing up of Pardon to the Conſcience, that there ſhould be no more Conſcience of Sin: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the Grand Pardon in the Court of Heaven was, as Mr. <hi>Pemble</hi> ſays, when Chriſt was delivered for our Offences, and raiſed for our Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication; which is not manifeſt to the Conſcience till Faith comes. And thus this Hereſie vaniſhes, having only left us a Teſtimony, that the <hi>Neonomians</hi> do Boggle in the point of Pardon, and would hook in our Faith to be a Joynt-Saviour with Chriſt, by being a procurer of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, rather than a Manifeſtation of it.</p>

               <p>It is an Amazement his 11th Hereſie, which is this, <hi>A Believer is to work from Life, and not for Life.</hi> For anſwer, If a Man be a Believer, he is a Living Member of Chriſt, and ſo he Works <hi>from</hi> Life in Chriſt: Sure then this cannot be the Hereſie intended here, to ſay he works <hi>from Life:</hi> Then this is his Hereſie, That a Believer works not <hi>for</hi> Life. But how can that be Hereſie? to ſay, A Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever doth not <hi>work</hi> for Life; when the word ſaith, <hi>The Gift of God is Eternal Life,</hi> Rom. 6.23. If it be <hi>Gift,</hi> then it is not <hi>Work'd</hi> for by us, do Men call that a Gift that is wrought for? that is, Wages; Death indeed is wrought for by Sin, <hi>for the Wages of Sin</hi> (which is in our beſt Works) <hi>is Death,</hi> but Life is the Free Gift of God: How then can it be called Hereſie to ſay, <hi>A Believer works not for Life?

Whither ſhall we run, if we do not maintain this for Truth, That a Believer works not, that he by his good Works might procure to himſelf Eternal Life? No; but he works from a Divine Principle of Life in him, that he may glorifie God for the Gift of Eternal Life, through his Son Jeſus Chriſt.

               <p>I anſwer. God ſaith, whom he loves, he loves to the end; whom he loves, he may Rebuke and Chaſten, and yet not be angry with them; he is angry with the Wicked every day; but as to his People he is God, and changes not, and his Kindneſs endures for ever: This is ſuch a Maxim, that 'tis the concluſion of every Verſe of the 136th <hi>Pſalm,</hi> we tranſlate it, <hi>His Mercy endures for ever,</hi> but the word is, <hi>chaſdo, his Kindneſs,</hi> 'tis that which endures for ever.

We may truly ſay, that God's Love to us, when he decreed to Save us, is one and the ſame, without Addition, with that which he manifeſts to us when he glorifies us,</hi> (if not, ſay I,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:41406:21"/> there is a Change in God) <hi>That holy Flame of Love burns as hot to us now as then; his Love to their Perſons is from Everlaſting the ſame; nor doth their Sinfulneſs leſſen it (though it may hide it) nor their San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity increaſe it; becauſe God, in loving their Perſons, never conſidered them otherwiſe, than as moſt perfectly Holy and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nblameable in Chriſt. God approves of their Perſons, while he diſallows their Corruptions; and when his fierceſt Wrath was ſhewed againſt their Sins, in the Perſon of Chriſt, then did God moſt compaſſionately love the Perſons both of Chriſt, and of all the Elect.</hi> O! that our New-law Men, would or could well weigh theſe Paſſages, highly conſiſtent with the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable unvariable immutable Nature of God.

But we muſt wait at the Throne of Grace in behalf of Oppoſers, for 'tis God alone gives Eye-ſalve, to ſee into the Myſtery of the unſearchable Riches of his Grace, to poor Sinners in Chriſt, that their Sinfulneſs doth not leſſen his Love to the Elect; though he ſtill hates Sin in them, as much as if they were Damned to Eternal Burnings for every Sin which is due to them; but they are borne and ſuffered for by our Bleſſed Lord Jeſus, the Juſt for the Unjuſt, by his once Suffering for Sins (even for all and every Sin of thoſe given to him from Eternity) that he might bring us to God: To whom be Glory for ever.</p>

               <p>The Sixteenth, <hi>All imperfect Holineſs is Sin.</hi> This methinks the Rebuker may bluſh to mention for an Hereſie, ſeeing the Scripture ſaith, He that errs in one point, is guilty of all, and <hi>Curſed is he that continues not in all things written in the Book of the Law to do them.</hi> So that the diſcontinuance a moment from doing all things commanded in the Law, brings a Curſe, if there be but the leaſt Deviation from the perfect Rule: So that if our Holineſs be in the leaſt ſhort of the full Requirement of the Law, it brings a Curſe, which it could not do if it were not Sin. But here lies the Core, the Heart of the <hi>Armenian</hi> Spirit as I take it, That God accepts imperfect Holineſs for Chriſt's ſake, in the ſtead of perfect: As for the firſt part, that God accepts imperfect Holineſs for Chriſt's ſake, the Orthodox do hold; but it is only as Chriſt hath taken away the Sin of the Imperfection, by his once offering himſelf for all the Sins of the Elect; but God never accepts it as perfect, or in the ſtead of perfect, that would be to accept it for what it is not, much leſs doth God accept us for our imperfect Holineſs: Beſides the Scripture ſaith, All our Righteouſneſſes are as filthy Rags, What is that but Sin? And the Aſſembly ſay, <hi>The beſt Works wrought by us are defiled;</hi> and if ſo, then 'tis no Hereſie to ſay, All imperfect Holineſs is Sin. And one would wonder how it ſhould enter into the Thoughts of theſe Antagoniſts, to ſubſcribe what they have done of the Aſſemblies Confeſſion, and yet aſſert that to be Hereſie, which is owned by them for ſolid Truth.</p>

               <p>The ſeventeenth Hereſie is to ſay, <hi>Turn ye, Turn ye, why will you dye? is but the triumph of the Law over a dead Sinner.</hi> Anſwer, The bare outward Call to Sinners to turn, you will grant, is not ſufficient to turn them; for they are, by Nature, dead in Sins and Treſpaſſes, and there muſt be an Almighty Power put forth to quicken them, beſides the bare Call, <hi>Turn ye, turn ye.</hi> It is God that muſt work both the Will and the Deed; for <hi>without me,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>you can do nothing.</hi> If ſo, what is the Call to turn, without the Spirit of God effecting the turn, but a manifeſtation of God's Right to command, which you may call the triumph of the Law? You will not ſay, that God hath loſt his Right to command us to turn to him, though we are dead, and are not able to turn, till there goes forth from God, with his Call, an Almighty ſaving Power of turning us to him; and on this account the Church prays, <hi>Turn thou me, and I ſhall be turned, Jer.</hi> 31.18.

               <p>The eighteenth is a very weak Hereſie, though a long one, and in truth no more a Hereſie, than 'tis Hereſie to ſay, Chriſt took not the Nature of Angels, but the Seed of <hi>Abraham;</hi> but however this comes in the Bed-roll, to fill up the number; and 'tis thus, <hi>The Eternal Life, in which the Angels were created and confirmed by Chriſt, differs from that Eternal Life which Believers have in Chriſt: The one is a Creature Life, or a created Life, the other is the Eternal Life of God communicated in time.</hi> This, though not of the Eſſence of Chriſtianity, or a Fundamental, may be a little explained, and ſo it will appear that it is no Hereſie. But ſome Perſons are glad of a ſmall Occaſion to quarrel. The only Ground for quarrelling at this Expreſſion, is, That the Life of a Believer is the <hi>Eternal Life of God;</hi> by which, I ſuppoſe, is meant of God-Man, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. Now take it in that Senſe, then Chriſt being the Life of every Believer, they have the Eternal Life of God-Man in them, ſo as the Angels have not. Chriſt took not their Nature; they are not
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:41406:23"/> Members of his Body, of his Fleſh, and of his Bones, and Believers are; <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.30. He is not their Reſurrection and Life, as he is the Believers. Is it not a great Truth, that by Vertue of their Union to Chriſt by Faith in his Fleſh and Blood, the Fleſh and Blood of him who is the Eternal Son of God, they have that Eternal Life in them, from him, which the Angels have not? As to the Eternal Life which the Angels have, and ſhall enjoy, what is it but a created Life? Whereas the Life of Chriſt in his Saints, and with them to all Eternity, is their participation of his Life, as he is more than a meer Creature, as he is God-Man; and they one with him, parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the Divine Nature, as the Branches partake of the very Nature of the Vine; not that they are Godded with Chriſt God-Man, but in an <hi>ineffable</hi> manner they partake of his Divine Nature, being made one Body, incorporated into him, and ſo one with him; which muſt comprehend an Eternal Life being in them, which is more than meerly created, they <hi>being filled with all the fulneſs of God, Eph.</hi> 3.19. That is, as they have Chriſt in them, the hope of Glory, in whom dwells the fulneſs of the Godhead Bodily, but in Believers he dwells only Spiritually.</p>

May not God the Father, or God the Son, aſſume what ſhape they pleaſe, as well as the Holy Spirit aſſumed the ſhape <hi>of a Dove,</hi> and yet that no Degradation or Humiliation? It is true, God is ſaid to humble himſelf to behold things in Heaven, but that is ſpoken Figuratively, as <hi>his Eyes behold, his Eye-lids try the Children of Men;</hi> but to ſay, God is humbled by it, is harſh; and ſo to ſay, that Chriſt's meer In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation was his Humiliation, is to deny him the liberty to aſſume what form he pleaſes, or to make it a diminution of his Glory, is what, I ſuppoſe, cannot well be maintained. I am ſure his Incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was a Glorious Exaltation of our Humane Nature; and would it not be harſh to ſay, he could not exalt our Nature without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing his own?

               <p>That this is their meaning, appears by what Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> (who ſeems to be their general Mouth) has ſaid, in his Preface to <hi>Man made Righteous by Chriſt's Obedience:</hi> Where he rebukes his <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomians</hi> for owning no Law of God, that admitted of faulty Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; and by way of Contempt to Mr. <hi>Cole, &amp;c.</hi> he ſaith, <hi>They own no Law but the Law of Works, which admitted nothing ſhort of perfect ſinleſs Obedience.</hi> So that he looks on it as an horrid Error to hold, that no Law is given by God that admitted of Obedience, that had Sin in it: Which ſhews plainly that they hold, that God has ſet up a Law in the room of the Moral Law; and that this their New Law, which they have invented for God, and wretchedly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute to God, it doth admit of Sin in the Obedience to it; than which there cannot be a more horrid Affront offered to the Holy God, <hi>viz.</hi> That God ſhould ſet up a Law that allows Sin. Now if contradict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch Doctrine as this, is accounted <hi>Antinomianiſm,</hi> then to be freed from their Slanders, we muſt rob God of his Honour, nay, deny him to be God, to comply with their Doctrine of charging on God his making a Law, that allows Sin in our Obedience to it. For I dare be bold to ſay, in Contradiction to ſuch an Aſſertion, and in Zeal to the pure Holy Nature of God, God never did, nay never can, and that's a bold word, but true, if God be God, and Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs his Nature, he never can make a Law that admits of any thing but <hi>Sinleſs Obedience:</hi> For God ſaith, <hi>he cannot behold Iniquity;</hi> and for any Man, or number of Men, or for any Angels of Heaven, to talk at that rate, for God to make a Law that admits of Sin, let him be <hi>accurſed.</hi> To talk of a Law that admits of Sin, is to make the Maker of ſuch a <hi>wooden Law</hi> to be little better than a <hi>wooden God.</hi> It is enough to make ones Fleſh to tremble, and Spirit riſe into a rage, againſt the bold ſtrokes of ſome Ungodly Pens that corrupt the Goſpel and Minds of Men, to talk of a Law of the Holy God that admits any thing of Sin. Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> and his Juſtifiers, have ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed to the <hi>Aſſemblies Confeſſion of Faith,</hi> and they ſay upon the Head of Repentance, <hi>There is no Sin ſo ſmall, but it deſerves Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation;</hi> and they juſtifie it by that Scripture, <hi>The Wages of Sin is Death.</hi> But our <hi>Neonomians,</hi> our New-Law Men, bring in God making a Law, that admits of <hi>Faulty Obedience,</hi> or Obedience that
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:41406:25" rendition="simple:additions"/> is not Sinleſs, which is all one with Faulty Obedience. Now my Dear <hi>Kratiſte,</hi> this Man's Champion, pray where is this accounted for? And if not, how can it be expected, that the Breach between the Orthodox and theſe ſhould be made up? <hi>Offences will come, but woe to that Man by whom they come.</hi> To ſuch a Man as would im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a Law, allowing Sinning Obedience: And if Sinning, then it hath Sin in it; and if ſo, and that the Aſſembly ſay right, (from the Wages of Sin being Death) <hi>the leaſt Sin, never ſo ſmall, deſerves Damnation,</hi> then they will bring in God making a Law, in comply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with which Men ſhall be damned: For Men ſhall be damned for Sinning Obedience, ſo far as the Law hath Power over any Man; and if they are ſaved, it cannot be by a Sinning Complyance with their New Law, but meerly of Grace, on account of the perfect Holy Law of God, which admits of nothing but Sinleſs Obedience, by its being fulfilled by our Lord Jeſus for us, and by his Blood taking away our Sins, in coming ſhort of the Holy Law of God. Now if our Rebuker will continue rebuking, I would pray he would imploy his Talent in rebuking ſuch Doctrines, as bring in a Law of God that allows of Sin, rather than on ſaying, <hi>We work from Life, and not for Life.</hi> Whereas 'tis a mad ſort of Work for Life, to work under their New Law that allows Sinning Obedience.</p>

Did he bear the Sins of many, and not their <hi>very</hi> Sins? Will he have ſo much audaciouſneſs as to make God a <hi>Cheat?</hi> To make us believe he laid our Sins on Chriſt; but when it comes to the up-ſhot, it is not our Sins, not our <hi>very</hi> Sins, but ſomewhat like our Sins; that is, Guilt imputed and Puniſhment borne, but for the <hi>very</hi> Sins they were not laid.</p>

If Dr. <hi>Criſp</hi> had ſaid, that <hi>Chriſt was made Sin and a Curſe,</hi> and the Scripture had been ſilent therein, Mr. <hi>Williams,</hi> and his Champion, might have had Ground for the Accuſation: But if ſo, why ſhould not Dr. <hi>Luther</hi> come in for a Snack, and Dr. <hi>Calvin</hi> for a Laſh? But as the Caſe is, Dr. <hi>Paul,</hi> the Apoſtle, muſt have the ſevereſt Stroke, for ſaying, <hi>God made our Lord Jeſus Sin for us, and a Curſe.</hi> But becauſe, for Shame, they will not charge him with groſs Blaſphemy for ſo ſaying, they will diſtinguiſh away the force of the Words, by ſaying, he meant that Chriſt bore the Puniſhment, and not the <hi>very Sins;</hi> but left the Sinner to bear them.</p>

               <p>And farther, that Dr. <hi>Criſp</hi> may not bear all the Load that theſe Rigid Gentlemen lay on him, I ſhall give ſome Humane Teſtimonies, which concur with him, though they have had abundance from Dr. <hi>Chancy,</hi> and others, which muſt needs convince their Conſcience, they being many of them unanſwered; but for the preſent purpoſe they muſt have ſome of them again; therefore let us ſee what Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> ſaith on <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.13. It is thus; <hi>Two Things are here to be conſidered, not only in the Perſon of Chriſt, but alſo in his Humanity: One is, That he was the Lamb of God, without Spot, full of Bleſſing and Grace. The other, That he took our Perſon; therefore he was a Sinner, and under the Curſe, not ſo much in himſelf as in us.</hi> O my
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:41406:27"/> Dear <hi>Kratiſte,</hi> why do you not ſpend ſome of your Talent on this uncouth novel, unintelligible Stuff of this Great Perſon, as well as on the Apochryphal Story of <hi>Tobias?</hi> And when your Hand is in, pray let Bold <hi>Martin Luther</hi> have a taſte of your ſowre Sauce on his ſweet Meat, which he gives you on <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.14. for he deſerves it more than the Doctor you are ſo diſpleaſed with; <hi>Luther</hi> ſaying, <hi>We may apply to Chriſts that whole</hi> 27.

He was therefore not only accurſed, but made a Curſe for us.</hi> (And a little above he ſaid), <hi>That he putting off his Innocency and Holineſs, and taking thy ſinful Perſon on him, might bear thy Sin, thy Death, thy Curſe.</hi> Why is not this <hi>criminated</hi> for the Dregs of <hi>Antinomianiſm?</hi> Being read with <hi>Arminian</hi> Spectacles, it may paſs for ſuch, but if read by the Light of the Holy Spirit, in the Glaſs of the Word, it will be found pure clear Water of Life flowing from the Fountain of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> the Rock that followed them, our Lord Jeſus Chriſt; <hi>Whom,</hi> for our Everlaſting Comfort, <hi>God made Sin for us, though he knew no Sin, that we might be made the Righteouſneſs of God in him:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I muſt confeſs I am amazed at the Uncharitableneſs of ſome Men, in charging the Doctor with making Chriſt a Murderer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as if he meant any otherwiſe than all ſound Orthodox Chriſtians do; that is, that he was only a Sinner by Imputation. And let my Dear <hi>Kratiſte</hi> but examine his Conſcience on conſulting the Doctor's Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, when his fierce Anger is allayed, and he will ſay, there is as Great and as Adorable a Senſe of the Glorious Excellency of our Lord Jeſus in his own Perſon, in thoſe Diſcourſes, as he can find in any writings he moſt applauds; and that notwithſtanding it muſt be ſtill aſſerted, or we muſt all be damned, That for the ſake of poor Sinners he was made Sin and a Curſe for us: And it is well known that the Doctor meant, and ſo expreſt himſelf, that he was ſo only by <hi>Imputation.</hi>

               <p>The next is a very unbeſeeming and dreadful Charge againſt the Doctor in Page 38, where the Rebuker ſaith, The Doctor had af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed <hi>a wild, monſtrous Senſe of Change of Perſon between Chriſt and

So that here is a direct Change; Chriſt takes our Perſon and Condition, and ſtands in our ſtead; we take Chriſt's Perſon and Condition, and ſtand in his ſtead. So that if you reckon well, you muſt always reckon your ſelves in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Perſon, and that other in your Perſon.</hi>

Pray what will Men make of this Righteouſneſs of God, which is the Righteouſneſs of God-Man Jeſus Chriſt the Mediator, his Righteouſneſs made ours, imputed to us, he being made of God to us Righteouſneſs? Do they make to be made this Righteouſneſs, is leſs than to be compleatly Righteous as Chriſt? Sure they will not ſo leſſen Chriſt, to make his Righteouſneſs to be ours, to be our being leſs Righteous than himſelf: If not, then this Righteouſneſs made ours, makes us, by Imputation, compleatly Righteous, as he is Righteous; which is the ſame as is his Name, <hi>The Lord our Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs.</hi> And I will preſume, theſe Oppoſers will not be ſo baſe as to pretend the Doctor meant any other way, of our being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatly Righteous as Chriſt, than by his Righteouſneſs made theirs, and imputed to them; whereupon he ſaith, <hi>Thou art all fair my

               <p>Well, but what ſhall we think of this part of the Monſter, <hi>We take Chriſt's Perſon and Condition, and ſtand in his ſtead?</hi> I hope it is no Monſter to ſay, <hi>Thou art all fair my Love, there is no ſpot in thee,</hi> as our Lord Jeſus ſaith of his Spouſe, who was fair through his Comelineſs put on her, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.14. though ſhe, in the ſenſe of her Sins, ſaid of her ſelf, <hi>Look not on me, becauſe I am Black.</hi> Did not ſhe appear as in the Perſon of Chriſt, cloathed with his Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs? Nay, was ſhe not joyned to him, when thus all fair, and ſo, being joyned to the Lord, became one Spirit? Could ſhe and Chriſt be one Spirit? Could ſhe have the Comelineſs of Chriſt upon her, and not appear in his Perſon? How could <hi>her</hi> Name, as well as <hi>his,</hi> be <hi>the Lord our Righteouſneſs,</hi> Jer. 33.16. &amp; 23.6. if ſhe did not take upon her the Perſon and Condition of Chriſt?

For what Benefit can we have by Chriſt's Death, if our Sins were not made his, and laid on him, and he made Sin for us? Or by his Righteouſneſs, if it be not made ours given to us, and we appear in it, in and through Jeſus Chriſt, before God? How could the Apoſtle ſay of any Man, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.7. <hi>He is Righteous as God is Righteous,</hi> but by his believing in Chriſt, where his Faith is accounted to him for Righteouſneſs? As <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Faith juſtified him, not his Act of Faith barely, but the Act taking in the Object of it, <hi>viz.</hi> Chriſt's Righteouſneſs; and ſo he truly <hi>doth Righteouſneſs</hi> that believes in the Lord Jeſus his Righteouſneſs and Strength; and thus doing Righteouſneſs, he becomes Righteous as he is Righteous, and to deny this, is to betray the Goſpel, in order to bring in our own Righteouſneſs to joyn it with Chriſts, <hi>as it were by the Works of the Law,</hi> Rom. 9.32. Or how are we accepted in the Beloved, if we do not appear in his Perſon before God, and ſo ſuſtain his Perſon? Is this a denying Chriſt, and betraying the Goſpel? O that God would anoint Mens Eyes with the <hi>Collirium,</hi> the Eye-Salve of the Spirit, then they would be able to bear the light of the Glory of God, as it ſhines on and in poor Creatures, in the Face of Chriſt, to make Righteous as he is Righteous, and not dazzle them, to make them call this <hi>betraying the Goſpel.</hi>

O how good is it to be humble, and not to tower to the top of all Learning, denying this phraſe to be in Scripture, Fathers or Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, when at the very threſhold we ſee one may fall: For here the very expreſs Scripture uſes the phraſe of the Apoſtles being in the <hi>Perſon</hi> of Chriſt, and forgiving an offending Brother in the <hi>Perſon</hi> of Chriſt. And ſo I hope we ſhall all learn to forgive one another, and not to rebuke with immoderate ſtrains, as our Rebuker hath very unwarrantably done, in charging the Doctor with wild monſtrous Senſe, and <hi>Apocryphal Phraſes,</hi> when he ſpeaks the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi>'s Language.</p>

               <p>I hope you will allow the Apoſtle to bring this Term, of our ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaining Chriſt's perſon into our <hi>Credenda,</hi> or Things to be believed, though the Doctor, whom for it you charge with <hi>Antinomian He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie,</hi> may not uſe the word without a ſevere Laſh. Is this to learn of our Lord Jeſus, who would excuſe his Diſciples, under failings, and not preſently bring them to the block, much leſs would he tax them with a wild monſtrous Senſe of Things, when they ſpake only the Senſe of the Scriptures? But why this Expreſſion ſhould be He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie in the Doctor, though Orthodox in the Apoſtle, I can quickly tell: It being, I reckon, from his having ſome Mens perſons in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration. Our <hi>Kratiſte</hi> having, ſome time ſince, preſt hard on the Conſcience of Mr. <hi>Williams,</hi> he is now raiſing up his Reputation; which he might ſuppoſe this a proper way for, by loading the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor with the Title of a <hi>Dreggy, Apocryphal Heretick,</hi> becauſe Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> had written ſo much againſt him in his <hi>Goſpel-Truth ſtated<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

So that Things being thus, Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> being to be redintegrated into publick applauſe, now if Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> ſay, <hi>I deny a Change, Kratiſte</hi> can do no leſs than ſay, <hi>The term of a Change is novel and unintelligible:</hi> If Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> ſay, <hi>This is Dr.</hi> Criſp'<hi>s Error or Miſtake, Kratiſte</hi> will exemplifie, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large

               <p>In Page 51, he offers us a <hi>moot Point,</hi> worthy to be taken notice of, thus, <hi>I would propound a moot Point, whether the</hi> Socinians, <hi>who have blaſphemouſly degraded the Perſon of Chriſt into a God by Office, though a meer Man by Nature; or the</hi> Antinomians, <hi>who own him to be a God by Nature, yet affirm him to have been a Sinner, the greateſt of Sinners, nay, Sinfulneſs it ſelf, do more derogate from the Honour of our Redeemer?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For Anſwer, This is ſo far from being a <hi>moot Point,</hi> that it is no point at all; unleſs you can find any of your <hi>Antinomians</hi> that aſſert what you here ſay they affirm. You cannot but know your <hi>Antino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mians</hi> own and aſſert ſtrenuouſly, That the Lord Jeſus was ever holy, harmleſs, ſeparate from Sin, a Lamb without ſpot in his own perſon, being perfect God and perfect Man; nay, they aſſert, he is ſo far from being a Sinner in himſelf, that being God-Man he <hi>cannot ſin,</hi> nay, he never could commit Sin, or be guilty of any Sin of his own All that they affirm of his being a Sinner, is only that he was ſo by <hi>Imputation</hi> only: As a King's Innocent Son, undertaking for a Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, may be a Thief or Murderer by <hi>Imputation,</hi> if he ſuffers for the Thief. And ſo <hi>Luther</hi> calls Chriſt the greateſt Sinner in the World; and yet Men dare not call <hi>Luther</hi> an <hi>Antinomian,</hi> whatever they think. And ſo to repute Chriſt an <hi>imputed Sinner,</hi> we are taught by the Bleſſed Apoſtle, when he ſaith, <hi>God made him Sin.</hi> And my Dear <hi>Kratiſte</hi> knows in his Conſcience, that not a Man of his <hi>Antinomians</hi> have any ſuch thought, expreſt by word, that our Bleſſed Lord Jeſus is a Sinner, any other way than by our Sins <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted</hi> to him; which nevertheleſs were as really made his, ſo as to bear them, and ſuffer for them, as if they had been committed by him; and yet though they were laid on him, and ſo made his, they, nor ten thouſand millions of times more Sins, were not able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>file or pollute, in the leaſt, his moſt Holy God like Body or Soul.

This is by the New Law of their coyning; which is to un-God the Holy God, and to make void the Death of Chriſt: For if God be ſuch a God, as makes a Law that admits of Sin, then he is not the true God; for God cannot behold Iniquity with the leaſt allowance, no, not the leaſt Iniquity of a vain Thought. And if the Blood of Chriſt doth not take away the Sin that cleaves to our moſt ſincere Obedience, we muſt periſh to all Eternity; becauſe the Soul that ſins muſt dye, either himſelf or his Surety for him, even for the leaſt Sin. And did not ſome Men count <hi>little Sins,</hi> to be <hi>little Things,</hi> they would not trifle with the Holy God, as if of <hi>courſe</hi> he paſt by <hi>little Sins,</hi> or that he hath made a Law that admits of that which is not <hi>Sinleſs Obedience.</hi> And becauſe Man's Law will not hang a Man for <hi>ſtealing a Pins head,</hi> they wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

So that ſtealing a Pins head needs the Blood of Chriſt, to waſh the Guilt away, as well as robbing 1000 <hi>l.</hi> on the Road needs it; for both need it, though the latter be the more heinous. And beſides their ungodding of God, by charging him with making a New Law that admits of Sin, they hereby make vain the Death of Chriſt: For if our imperfect Obedience may be accepted for perfect, without waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away the Imperfections or Sins in it, by Faith in the Blood of Jeſus to waſh away thoſe, and all our Sins, then Chriſt's Death is in vain. For if little Sins may paſs without the Redeemer's Blood, waſhing them away, then may great ones alſo; for without ſhed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of Blood there is no remiſſion; and it is the Blood of Chriſt which cleanſes from all Sin. If from all, then from <hi>little,</hi> as well as from <hi>great;</hi> and if not from <hi>little ones,</hi> then alſo not from <hi>great.</hi> But it doth cleanſe from all; therefore there can be no Law of God's making that admits of Sin.

<pb n="62" facs="tcp:41406:36" rendition="simple:additions"/> God, hath ſet up a Law that admits Sin in the Obedience. If this be not <hi>Antinomianiſm</hi> there is none in the World.

Some Perſons queſtion his owning Chriſt's making a full proper Satisfaction; I wiſh that he had not given too much occaſion, by ſuch paſſages as theſe, not to inſiſt ſo <hi>ſtrictly</hi> on it, that Chriſt paid a <hi>rigid, proper Satisfaction</hi> for Sins.

O! why ſhould we not inſiſt <hi>ſtrictly</hi> on that which is one of the moſt comfortable Notions in all the Book of God, in all the Revelation of Grace, by Jeſus Chriſt, That our Lord Jeſus paid our <hi>Debts?</hi> Why doth our Lord Jeſus bid us pray to the Father to forgive us our <hi>Debts,</hi> if he had not made Satisfaction to the Father, and paid them? Would you have God forgive our Debts without receiving <hi>Satisfaction?</hi> That's <hi>Socinian</hi> Language in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, and you pretend to be much againſt them.

So that he makes <hi>our good Works</hi> to be <hi>our Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> I begin with his ſecond, as being moſt of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh ſcent, <hi>Our good Works have the ſame reſpect to Glory that the Foundation hath to the Building.</hi> Was ever any thing more <hi>Popiſh?</hi> Doth not the Scripture ſay, <hi>I lay in Zion for a Foundation, a Stone, a tryed Stone,</hi> Iſa. 28.16.?

O how con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary is his Aſſertion to the whole Goſpel, which ſaith, <hi>We are ſaved by Grace, and not of Works, leſt any Man ſhould boaſt.</hi> Our Glory is ſo far from being the Harveſt of our Works, that the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>He hath ſaved us, not according to our Works of Righteouſneſs which we have done,</hi> 2. Tim. 1.9. Neither for our Works, nor according to them. O how ſad is it that my Dear <hi>Kratiſte</hi> ſhould by his Hand, together with Forty Eight more, midwife this rotten Egg into the World. The third is of the ſame brood, <hi>That Glory is the Wages of our Works;</hi> which is diametrically oppoſite to the Apoſtle, who wholly excludes Works, ſaying in <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.6. <hi>If it be by Grace, it is no more of Works; otherwiſe Grace is no more Grace.

<pb n="80" facs="tcp:41406:45"/> excluded. By what Law? of Works? Nay; but by the Law of Faith.</hi> So that Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> muſt not lay this Egg at the Apoſtle's Gate; it being as rotten an one as any in the whole Council of <hi>Trent:</hi> But one daſh of the Rebuker's Pen, That he hath accounted for what he hath written, by ſubſcribing the Aſſemblies Confeſſion, ſhall cleanſe him from all; whereas his ſubſcribing that, without his recanting this, is but like ſome of the Clergy in <hi>Antiſozzo, that ſnatch up the Pen to ſubſcribe the Articles of the Church of</hi> England, <hi>and to their ſhame, immediately preach againſt ſome of them, in advancing Man's Free-will in oppoſition to God's Free Irreſiſtible Grace, and denying particular Election,</hi> and the like: For which we may mourn and ſay, <hi>Proh Dolor.</hi>

And thence might as well ſay, that Chriſt's Righteouſneſs, which he performed in obeying and ſuffering the Law, is not ours, it was only wrought for our Good, and ſo we not juſtified by God's imputing it to us; but that we have only the Effects of it, or this is the main, <hi>viz.</hi> Pardon of our Sins, if we repent, and believe, and walk in holy Obedience, and ſo continue to the end of our Lives (thereby denying aſſurance

<pb n="83" facs="tcp:41406:46"/> place of <hi>Moſes, Accurſed is every one that hangeth on a Tree,</hi> ſo may we apply to Chriſt not only that whole 27 <hi>Deut.</hi> but alſo may gather all the Curſes of <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Law together; for as Chriſt is innocent in this General Law, touching his own Perſon, ſo is he alſo in all the reſt; and as he is guilty in this General Law, in that he is made a Curſe for us, and hanged on the Croſs as a Wicked Man, a Blaſphemer, a Murderer, a Traytor, even ſo he is guilty in all others.</q> Here <hi>Luther</hi> makes Chriſt to bear the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's diſpleaſure with a Vengeance, bear our Sin, Death and Curſe; yea, all the Curſes in <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Law.</p>

               <p>But what need have we of Humane Teſtimony for this, although ſuch Teſtimony is more authentick with ſome, and will paſs farther in Proof with ſome than <hi>David</hi>'s <hi>Pſalms,</hi> or <hi>Paul</hi>'s <hi>Epiſtles,</hi> for God's diſpleaſure with Chriſt, as bearing our Sins, and our Perſons, and as being our Surety and our Repreſentative? Therefore becauſe Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> is ſo foul on Dr. <hi>Criſp,</hi> for aſſerting God's diſpleaſure againſt Chriſt for our Sins, and my Dear <hi>Kratiſte</hi> ſeems afraid to declare his plain Senſe in this Point, pretending to ſave Time and Paper, and thereby leaving Dr. <hi>Criſp</hi> under the foul Pen of Mr. <hi>Williams,</hi> whoſe Cauſe the Rebuker vindicates, on this account I think it neceſſary to bring good Scripture Proof of God's diſpleaſure againſt his own ever-dearly beloved Son; our Lord Jeſus, as he ſtood in our ſtead bearing our Sins; for which I produce the 22th, the 25th, the 69th and 89th Pſalms, to ſhew that Chriſt was under the diſpleaſure of God. In <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22.1. he cryes out, <hi>Why art thou ſo far from helping me? Why haſt thou forſaken me, and are far from the words of my roaring?</hi> Surely God's forſaking was ſufficient ground for his roaring. In <hi>Pſal.</hi> 35.17. he ſaith, <hi>Lord, how long wilt thou look on? Reſcue my Soul.</hi> And <hi>ver.</hi> 22. <hi>O Lord, be not far from me.</hi> So that here is forſaking even to make him roar; and here he minds God of ſtanding far off, and looking on while he is in his Agony. And can any one think there was no diſpleaſure in God when he did ſo? In <hi>Pſal.</hi> 69.3. he cryes, <hi>Mine Eyes fail while I wait for my God.</hi> (Surely then God had withdrawn from him). <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach hath broken my Heart,</hi> ſays he, <hi>ver.</hi> 20. <hi>I looked for pity, but there was none.</hi> Thus we ſee God looking on, and not comforting him under this terrible Diſpenſation, when his Heart was broken with Reproach; and could God with-hold his Comforts ſo long as
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:41406:47"/> he did, if he had not executed his diſpleaſure on Chriſt, which was due to us for our Sin? But that which puts it beyond doubt, is that <hi>direful, doleful</hi> word of our Lord Jeſus, in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89. where he ſhews, how Reproach had broken his Heart, in <hi>ver.</hi> 38. he ſaith, <hi>But thou hast caſt off and ABHORRED, thou haſt been wroth with thine Anointed,</hi> (thy Chriſt). That this abhorring was ſpoken in the Name of Chriſt appears farther, in <hi>ver.</hi> 50. <hi>I do bear in my boſom the Reproach of all the mighty People; wherewith they have reproached the footſteps of thine Anointed.</hi> This the Apoſtle ſhews is ſpoken of Chriſt, in <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.3. <hi>The Reproaches of them that reproached thee are fallen on me,</hi> ſaith he. Whence it is clear, that if the one is ſpoken of Chriſt, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Reproach,</hi> then it follows that the other, the <hi>abhorring,</hi> is ſpoken alſo of him; for they are joyned together <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89. And if ſo, what Sun-beam can be clearer than this, That our Lord Jeſus, if under this <hi>abhorring,</hi> he was under the ſore <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure</hi> of his Father, as bearing our Sins? Now for Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> to tell the World his dreadful Story againſt Dr. <hi>Criſp,</hi> for his uſing the ſame words of Chriſt as the Spirit of God doth, and with the ſame Senſe, <hi>viz.</hi> That this diſpleaſure of God was only upon ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of Chriſt's bearing our Sins, and that he was made a Curſe for us, not in reſpect of his own Holy, Innocent Perſon, but as bearing our Perſons; for Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> to load the Doctor ſo foully as he doth, and for the Rebuker to ſay nothing hereto, is ſeemingly to juſtifie Mr. <hi>Williams,</hi> and makes one fear he doth not reckon that Chriſt was under any diſpleaſure of the Father, nor that Chriſt bare our Sins, our <hi>very</hi> Sins, or was made a Curſe, a <hi>very</hi> Curſe, any more than Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> doth. But Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> abſolutely denies that Chriſt bare our <hi>very</hi> Sins; and if the Rebuker did not concur with him therein, he would doubtleſs have ſpent a little Time and Paper on ſo important a Point, rather than in calling his Oppoſers <hi>whaffling Whelps.</hi> But of this, God willing, more anon in another Section; in the mean time, this Teſtimony of Chriſt's bearing the Father's diſpleaſure may humble us all.</p>

               <p>This I find ingeniouſly and fully anſwered by Dr. <hi>Chancy,</hi> who asks Mr. <hi>Williams,</hi> What difference there is between God's wrathful In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation, as Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> owns; and to be, as it were, abhorred of God, as Dr. <hi>Criſp</hi> mentions? But that I may more fully clear this, from being a dangerous Notion of Dr. <hi>Criſp</hi>'s, I have recourſe to the Scriptures of the Old Teſtament in the Original, to ſee what is there ſaid, of Chriſt's being under the Father's Diſpleaſure; and there I find, <hi>in Terminis,</hi> that our Lord Jeſus Chriſt is ſpoken of, as <hi>abhorred</hi> of God, when made a Curſe for us, bearing our Sins, and made Sin. The place is plain, in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.38. there 'tis ſaid, <hi>Thou haſt caſt off and abhorred, thou haſt been wrath with thine anointed.</hi> And who is this anointed one, whom the Lord did caſt off and abhor, and was wrath with, but our bleſſed Lord Jeſus? So the whole <hi>Pſalm</hi> ſhews, eſpecially the 36th Verſe, <hi>His Seed ſhall endure for ever;</hi> and Verſe 51, <hi>Thine enemies have reproached the footſteps of thine anointed:</hi> And that theſe Reproaches are thoſe that Chriſt bore, compare <hi>Pſal.</hi> 69.9. with <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.3. <hi>The Reproaches of them that reproached thee, fell upon me,</hi> ſaith Chriſt. Hence 'tis plain, that theſe are the words of our Lord Jeſus to his Father, <hi>Thou haſt caſt off and abhorred:</hi> The words are ſevere in the Hebrew, <hi>ve attah zanaſhta;</hi> and thou haſt <hi>eloyned,</hi>

               <p>FInding the Controverſie maintained, concerning a Change of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons between Chriſt and Believers, and Dr. <hi>Criſp</hi> much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected on in a Letter, that Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> hath procured, from the Reverend Biſhop of <hi>W</hi>— in order to juſtifie himſelf from the Charge of his denying a Change, I cannot well avoid ſaying a word or two to the ſaid Letter, with great deference to the Author. I commend Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> for fleeing for Refuge to Men of Name; but all the Names and Men in the World cannot help him in this Caſe, when he had abſolutely <hi>denyed a Change.</hi> Now to be thought <hi>to own a Change,</hi> unleſs he firſt plainly owns his Error in his flat deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Change, he may not fairly ſhift it off, that he owned it in <hi>a</hi> Senſe, but diſowned it in the <hi>Doctor</hi>'s Senſe; when, without any di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction, he ſaid plainly thus, <hi>Whether there be a Change, this the Doctor affirms, and I deny.</hi> Which is ſo manifeſt a denyal of a Change in any Senſe, as words can in general make it. 'Tis as if I ſhould ſay, I went into <hi>Paul</hi>'s Church to hear the Organs, and there was not a Man there. I ſaw a Singing-Boy, and he ſaid, there was a Man there. The Boy affirmed there was a Man there. This the Boy ſaid, and this I deny. Can I help my ſelf, and ſay, there was a Man in a Surplice, but there was not a Biſhop there, or a Doctor there? This is a ſorry ſhift, with an untruth into the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, for me to ſay, there was not a Man there; and then ſhift it off with, I owned there was a Man in a Surplice there. So Mr. <hi>Williams, Whether there be a Change, this the Doctor affirms, and I deny.</hi> This, <hi>a Change,</hi> here muſt, in all ordinary acceptation of the words, be taken for any Change, without any ſort of diſtinction. This I deny ſaid Mr. <hi>Williams.</hi> Now to help him over this ſtile, he troubles the Biſhop, whom I honour as a Perſon of great Worth and Learning, though I cannot admire that ſort of Station, of Lord-Biſhop, in the Church of the Living God, which very Station might occaſion the Treatiſe of <hi>The Miſchief of Separation,</hi> and produced my Dear <hi>Kratiſte</hi>'s <hi>Miſchief of Impoſition,</hi> yet I make bold to ſay, with Thanks to the Biſhop, How warily ſoever he writes, as to clearneſs in the Point of Commutation, yet he writes with wonderful <hi>Modeſty,</hi> and, in every Tittle, like a <hi>Gentleman,</hi> not be-heriticking, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtring
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:41406:58"/> Dr. <hi>Criſp,</hi> as the Rebuker hath unaccountably done; but like a Chriſtian Gentleman, and Scholar, ſaith mildly, <hi>This I take to be Dr.</hi> Criſp<hi>'s Senſe of the Change of Perſons,</hi> not with a <hi>ruff-hewen Pen,</hi> This is Dr. <hi>Criſp</hi>'s <hi>Dreggy Antinomianiſm,</hi>

               <p>But to the Biſhop's Argument; he ſaith, <hi>This I take to be Dr.</hi> Criſp<hi>'s Senſe of the Change of Perſons; It is ſuch a Senſe as implies an Actual Tranſlation of the Perſonal Guilt of all the Sins of Believers on Chriſt, and his Perſonal Righteouſneſs on them.</hi> But note, the Doctor men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned not <hi>Perſonal</hi> Guilt, nor <hi>Actual</hi> Tranſlation, but kept himſelf firm on the Scripture Foundation, of <hi>Chriſt being made Sin for us, and we made the Righteouſneſs of God in him.</hi> From whence he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers, If Chriſt was made Sin for us, he was as ſinful as we, that is, by <hi>Imputation;</hi> and if we are made the Righteouſneſs of God, we are as Righteous as he, that is, as Chriſt God-Man with his Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torial Righteouſneſs wrought out for us, and imputed to us; than which, what can be a more clear Conſequence, if we are the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of God? But to evade this, or to reflect on the Doctor, the Biſhop ſaith, <hi>Concerning the Tranſlation of Guilt, which reſults from the Act of Sin committed, if this Guilt be tranſlated, Chriſt muſt become the very Perſon who committed the Sins; and ſo he must be look'd on, not only as an Actual Sinner, but as the Perſon who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted all the Sins of thoſe for whom he dyed? Which comes near to horrid Blaſphemy.</hi> This is a ſtrange Inference, for one of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop's Learning. Could not Chriſt as our Surety, ſuſtaining the Perſons of Sinners, ſtand in their place and ſtead; and as their Sponſor, pay their Debts, and anſwer for their Sins laid on him, unleſs he become the very Perſon that committed the Sins? This takes away all Suretyſhip. Surely he may be in the place of <hi>David,</hi> and bear the Sin of his Murder and Adultery; and it being imputed to him, he may bear it away, and he may be <hi>reckoned as,</hi> and <hi>repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as,</hi> the Murderer, and yet not be the Murderer; or elſe how could God, in Juſtice, puniſh him, and take pleaſure to bruiſe him, as our old Proteſtant Divines argue all along from <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53?</p>

               <p>Well, what doth the Biſhop own then? As far as I can ſee, not one Tittle of our Sins being by God <hi>laid</hi> on Chriſt, or of Chriſt's <hi>bearing</hi> our Sins, which is the <hi>Life and Soul of the Goſpel,</hi> and of all Conſolation to poor Sinners that flee for refuge to him; but only that Chriſt under-went the deſerved Puniſhment of our Sins; that is, he was puniſh'd for <hi>nothing,</hi> in a manner: For if he did not bear our Sins, if they were not made his by God's laying them on him, why was he puniſh'd? His words are theſe, <hi>A Mediatour was accepted ſo as, upon acceptance of his Sacrifice, the Offenders may be pardoned, and received into the Grace and Favour of God, on ſuch terms as he has declared in the Goſpel: And in this Senſe</hi> (ſaith the Biſhop) <hi>the Guilt of our Sins was charged on Chriſt, as our Mediator, who was to bear the Puniſhment of our Sins.</hi> Here's a Sacrifice accepted, but no Sins done away by it. Here Offenders may be pardoned, but 'tis on their complying with the nameleſs Terms of the Goſpel, which, at the bottom, is our ſincere Holineſs to the end of our Lives: Much like the Papiſts, <hi>Chriſt merited that our good Works ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure Salvation.</hi> Here is likewiſe the Senſe on which the <hi>Guilt</hi> of our Sins was charged on Chriſt, <hi>viz. If the Sinner complies with the Terms of the Goſpel, then he may be pardoned and received into the Grace and Favour of God.</hi> This is ſo ſtrange a Senſe of the Guilt of our Sins <hi>charged</hi> on Chriſt, that it is next door to Nonſenſe, to ſay, he did <hi>bear</hi> them 1600 Years ago, if we comply now: For either the Guilt was laid on Chriſt, when he was on the Croſs, when he bare our Sins, or it was never laid on him, and never ſhall be; for he ſuffered once for all. And if it was then laid on him, then we are not to merit Pardon, Grace and Favour now, by our complying with the Terms of the Goſpel now? Which Goſpel is taking the Waters of Life freely; but Pardon, Grace and Favour, is all me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited by Chriſt's bearing our <hi>Sins,</hi> and the <hi>Guilt,</hi> and the <hi>Puniſhment,</hi> he being all in all, the alone and compleat Saviour, who ſaves his People from their Sins.</p>

               <p>The Biſhop hath by this account of Chriſt's bearing only the <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment</hi> of our Sins, and the <hi>Guilt,</hi> in a Senſe, if we comply with Goſpel-Terms, he hath <hi>evaded</hi> thoſe Glorious Texts of Scripture, that are multiplyed in the word of Salvation, that teſtifie that our bleſſed Lord Jeſus bare our very Sins, and carried them away. As
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:41406:59"/> for inſtance in a few: It is ſaid in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. he <hi>bare our Griefs:</hi> Our very Griefs, that were due to us, he bare them. Then 'tis ſaid, he <hi>carried our Sorrows.</hi> As a Porter carries a Pack, ſo our Lord Jeſus had this burden laid on his Back, and he carried away thoſe very Sorrows that we ſhould have groaned under to all Eternity. Then he was <hi>wounded for our Tranſgreſſion;</hi> which could not be in Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, unleſs he had our Tranſgreſſion charged on him. Then he was <hi>bruiſed for our Iniquities:</hi> Ours by committing of them, but his when bruiſed for them; or elſe you make God unjuſt, to bruiſe one for the iniquity of another, if that other did not take them on himſelf. And in the next place, <hi>The Chaſtiſement of our Peace was upon him:</hi> That Chaſtiſement which effected and wrought out our Peace, without any work of ours, that Chaſtiſement was upon him. Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly none will ſay now, that Chriſt bore the Chaſtiſement which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured our Peace, and that God will lay Chaſtiſements on his own Children, for that end, to procure their Peace with God: No, God's Chaſtiſements are for another end, on his People, <hi>viz.</hi> to make them partakers of his Holineſs; but their Peace was made before, when the Chaſtiſement of our Peace was on Chriſt, which was when he was on the Croſs. But how came all this on Chriſt, that he ſhould bear our Griefs, our Sorrows, our Wounds, our Bruiſes, and our Chaſtiſements? This he ſhews in <hi>ver.</hi> 6. becauſe <hi>the Lord laid on him the Iniquity of us all. Here, here,</hi> is the crowning Point, this daſhes to pieces the Head of Leviathan, the Lord himſelf did this great Work, he cauſed the Iniquity of us all to meet on Chriſt; there the Lord fix'd it, there the poyſonous Dart, of <hi>the Iniquity of us all,</hi> ſtuck in the ſide of the Bleſſed Jeſus, till he cryed out, <hi>It is finiſh'd; and gave up the ghoſt.</hi> Sure here is more than bare Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in this great word, <hi>The Lord laid on him the Iniquity of us all.</hi> His bearing the Puniſhment was inſiſted on over and over before, when it was ſaid, he was ſmitten, ſtricken and afflicted, he was wounded, bruiſed and chaſtiſed; but here the Lord brings in the Ground and Reaſon of all this, how he came to endure all this, <hi>the Lord laid on him the Iniquity of us all:</hi> The word is, <hi>Vaihovah hiph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giya,</hi> and the Lord made to <hi>fall,</hi> or <hi>fall foul,</hi> on him the Iniquity of us all. So that our Iniquity, our very Iniquity, fell foul on Chriſt, and put him to that Puniſhment, to thoſe Wounds and Scourges, <hi>that</hi> crowned him with Thorns, <hi>that</hi> nailed him to the Croſs, <hi>that</hi> pierced his Side. <hi>The Lord laid on him the Iniquity of
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:41406:59"/> us all,</hi> the Lord did this, I may allude to <hi>Saul,</hi> who ſent <hi>Doeg the Edomite</hi> to fall foul on <hi>Abimelech,</hi> the Prieſt of <hi>Nob, Go thou,</hi> ſaid <hi>Saul,</hi> 1 Sam. 22.18. <hi>do thou turn, and fall on the Prieſt.</hi> The word is the ſame as <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.6. do thou <hi>phegay,</hi> do thou <hi>ruſh</hi> on them. <hi>Then Doeg the Edomite,</hi> he did <hi>iphgay,</hi> the ſame word, <hi>he ruſhed on him, and ſlew in that day Eighty Five.</hi> So our Iniquity, the Lord made that to <hi>ruſh</hi> on Chriſt, and <hi>ſlay him;</hi> that was <hi>the Doeg, the Edomite,</hi> which the great King, the Lord God Almighty, cauſed to ruſh on Chriſt, and ſlay him. As much as to ſay, God could not juſtly puniſh, wound and bruiſe, his dearly beloved Son, he could not give him Grief, Sorrow and Stripes, for our <hi>Iniquity,</hi> unleſs our <hi>ve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>y Iniquity</hi> was laid on Chriſt; the Prophet proceeds, becauſe God knew all theſe Teſtimonies were not enough to ſilence the proud quarrelling Nature of Man, againſt Chriſt's bearing our very Sins; and ſaith in <hi>ver.</hi> 10. <hi>It pleaſed the Lord to bruiſe him. Jehovah chapetz dacce-o,</hi> the Lord took delight in pounding him, as Spice is pounded in a Mortar, or as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> pounded the Manna in a Mortar, <hi>Numb.</hi> 11.8. it being the ſame word. Then he ſhews, why it pleaſed the Lord thus to pound him; for ſaith he, <hi>Thou ſhalt make his Soul an Offering for Sin;</hi> or thou ſhalt make his Soul a <hi>Guilt</hi> Offering. Then in <hi>ver.</hi> 11. he ſhews what this making his Soul a <hi>Guilt</hi> Offering conſiſted in, <hi>viz.</hi> bearing their Iniquities; for he ſaith expreſly, <hi>He ſhall bear their Iniquities, Yavonoth-am hu isbal,</hi> their very Iniquities himſelf he ſhall bear, or carry, as a Porter car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries away a pack. He don't mince the matter, or ſay with the Biſhop, he ſhall only bear the <hi>Puniſhment</hi> due to their Iniquities, and in a <hi>Senſe the Guilt</hi> on the Offenders complying, but he ſaith round<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>He ſhall bear their Iniquities;</hi> that is, thoſe very Iniquities which deſerved the Puniſhment before mentioned. And the Scripture fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeing what diſtinctions and evaſions would be made, the Holy Ghoſt to fortifie and compleat the matter, ſums up all in the laſt Verſe, and ſaith, <hi>He poured out his Soul unto death, and he BARE the Sin of many.</hi> Here is another word for bearing, and the proper word it is for bearing away, <hi>Chete rabbim naſa,</hi> the Sin of many he <hi>bare.</hi> Now put all theſe together, and can the Wit of Man, or Wiſdom of Angels, find out Words more plain and full, more clear and ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous, for Chriſt's bearing our Sins, our very Sins? The bleſſed Lord knowing what ſhifts, windings and turnings, would be made to evacuate, to exinanitiate this great Point of Chriſt's being made
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:41406:60"/> Sin, and bearing our Sins, therefore in his Grace and Wiſdom, to ſtop all mouths, he reiterates the Expreſſion and delineates the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with all the <hi>Flowery Varugation,</hi> to invite our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The New Teſtament concurs in the ſame way of expreſſing Chriſt's taking away our very Sins, as in 1 <hi>John</hi> 3, 5. <hi>The Son of God was manifeſted to take away our Sins:</hi> He not only bare the Puniſhment, but he bare the <hi>very Sins;</hi> and he bare them ſo effectually, as to take them away; and therefore he is called, <hi>The Lamb of God, that taketh away the Sin of the World,</hi> John 1.29. How could he take them away, if he bare only the Puniſhment, upon account of the Guilt laid on him on the Offenders compliance, whereas the Fault is denied to be laid on him: So that with our New Divinity, he took away <hi>Faultleſs Sin,</hi> which in moſt Mens Opinions, muſt be no Sin at all: But the Scripture is plain, <hi>He took away Sin, he appeared to put
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:41406:61" rendition="simple:additions"/> away Sin, by the Sacrifice of himſelf,</hi> Heb. 9.26. So that to inſiſt on Chriſt's bearing Puniſhment for Sin, and not bearing the Sin it ſelf, is not Scripture Dialect; we ſhall loſe the Goſpel, and our Chriſtian Religion, if we forſake Scripture Terms, eſpecially in this great Caſe, of Chriſt's being made Sin, and bearing our Sin, and taking it quite away, ſo as never, by God, to be remembred more; for theſe are his words, <hi>their Sins, and their Iniquities, I will remember no more,</hi> Heb 9.22. and repeated, for the Confirmation of that which Fleſh and Blood cannot receive, in <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.17. Now can any one imagine, that when our Lord Jeſus took away Sin, by his Death and Oblation of himſelf on the Croſs, that he left the Guilt, or the Fault behind. This is Nonſenſe, to take away <hi>Faultleſs Sin,</hi> we ſhould be but little the better for the Death of Chriſt. If he left the Guilt or Fault for us to remove by Repentance, or any of our good Works, which at beſt are ſo far from helping to waſh away the Guilt or Fault, that they need to be waſh'd in the Blood of Chriſt, to take away their own Guilt and Fault; and the making one Debt for our Lord Jeſus, to ſatisfie even that of the Fault in our beſt Works, is a ſtrange way for our clearing our ſelves from a former Debt or Fault.</p>

Theſe <hi>Homilies</hi> ſpeak home to the Point that the Biſhop is upon, of Chriſt's bearing our Sins; Thoſe Holy Servants of the Lord that compoſed them, ſoon after the Nations coming out of the Blind Popiſh Religion, they ſay, in the ſecond Sermon of Man's Miſery, thus, <hi>He</hi> (Chriſt) <hi>paid our Ranſom to God with his own Blood, and with that he CLEANSED us from our Sin.</hi> They don't ſay he bare the Puniſhment only, but he by his Blood (ſhed on the Croſs then at that time) he cleanſed us from our Sins: How could that be, if our Sins, our very Sins, were not then tranſlated to Chriſt? as Dr <hi>Criſp,</hi> from the Scripture, and theſe Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, ſaith. So that for Mr. <hi>Williams,</hi> or the Biſhop, or any Man,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:41406:61" rendition="simple:additions"/> to ſay, it is near Blaſphemy, to ſay our very Sins were laid on Chriſt, is to run a Dagger to the Heart of the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and to evade plain Scripture, as well as to make Dr <hi>Criſp</hi> an <hi>Antinomian</hi> for it; for the Doctor herein runs parallel to the Sound Orthodox Doctrine of the Church, for which, beſides the main Bulwark of the Scripture, he hath many Acts of Parliament to back him from the Slanders of the Deſpiſers of the Free Grace of God.</p>

               <p>I being now peruſing theſe Homilies, and conſidering how the Reverend Biſhop, in his Letter, inſiſts ſo much on Conditions, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired by God of Man, in order to God's Favour, I make bold to make a little Remark, how much the Biſhop differs from thoſe An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Doctors of the Church, and from himſelf, if he be true to his Subſcription to the Doctrines of the Church. Firſt, let us ſee what the Biſhop ſaith; then, what the Homilies ſay. In <hi>Page</hi> 67, the Biſhop ſaith, <hi>I could eaſily prove, that in all the Tranſactions between God and Mankind, ſome Conditions on our ſide were required in order to his Favour: So it was in the State of Innocency,</hi> (a tydy Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) <hi>ſo it continued after Man's Fall— But I paſs over theſe, and come to the Terms of Salvation, as declared by Christ himſelf— The main Buſineſs of his Preaching, was to put Men upon performing ſuch Conditions as were neceſſary to their Salvation—Promiſing Bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to the Humble, Merciful, Pure in heart,</hi> Matt. 5.3, 4, &amp;c. <hi>What do theſe things mean, if they be not Conditions on our parts, neceſſary in order to Happineſs?—But (God) he ſtill inſiſts on our own endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, by ſtriving to enter,</hi> &amp;c <hi>Do not theſe note the neceſſity of the Performance of Conditions on our ſide? And therefore all Imaginary Notions, of ſuch a Change of Perſons as hath no regard to any Act of ours, is wholly repugnant to the main Scope and Deſign of the Goſpel.</hi> Thus the Biſhop. What is become here of the whole Tenor of the Goſpel, we are Saved by Grace, being Juſtified freely by his Grace, through the Redemption that is in Jeſus, <hi>not of Works, leſt any boaſt,</hi> this is thruſt quite out of doors; for what are theſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, and theſe Acts of ours, but Works, which though called for, and neceſſary to glorifie God by way of Service and Thanks, yet not any way to Juſtifie us, or Save us, <hi>For we are Saved by Grace, and not of Works, otherwiſe Grace is no more Grace.</hi> 'Tis for another end, that all our Holineſs is called for, to Repent, be Humble, Pure
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:41406:62" rendition="simple:additions"/> of Heart, and Merciful: 'Tis to magnifie God, that hath ſaved us by Chriſt: Saints ſhall be Holy, Humble, Pure of Heart in Heaven: Is that in order to get God's Favour? No; but to ſerve and glorifie God for his Favour; and we are to do the Will of God, as near as we can, on Earth, as it is done in Heaven; not to get Heaven (which Chriſt alone hath bought for us) but to magnifie God for giving him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, Son and Spirit to us; and for giving Heaven, and all Spiritual Bleſſings, with him, begun in this Life, and perfected above, to make our Works Conditions on our parts, to get Heaven, is to Rob our Lord Jeſus of his Crown and Glory, and to ſet it on the Head of our ſorry imperfect Works. But beſides the whole Current of the Goſpel, that we are ſaved by Grace, let us ſee what the Biſhop hath ſigned to, and is dignified by, even the Doctrines of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and they are clear for our Intereſt in Chriſt, and Salvation, to be all of Grace; they drive us from all Works of our own, and ſay, in that ſecond Sermon of <hi>Man's Miſery, No part of our Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation is of our ſelves,</hi> no part, not the leaſt dram of our Works is to come in for any ſhare in our Juſtification. And in the next line they ſay, <hi>Our Juſtification cometh only by Jeſus Christ:</hi> Here is not the leaſt tittle of our Acts of Obedience inſiſted on, or Goſpel-Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, to get Salvation, 'tis only by Chriſt; all they inſiſt on, is to render Thanks to God for Free Salvation by Chriſt, as it follows, <hi>What Thanks, worthy and ſufficient, can we render to him? Let us burſt forth with joyful Voice, praiſing this Lord of Mercy.</hi> Then they reiterate our not being able to do any thing of our ſelves, wholly to renounce our ſelves, and ſay, very unlike the Biſhop's Letter, <hi>In our ſelves we may not glory, which of our ſelves are NOTHING but Sinful; neither may we rejoyce in any Works we do.</hi> How! nothing but Sinful; and no rejoycing in any Works we do; May we not Joy in performing the Conditions, and doing Acts to obtain God's Favour? <hi>No, no;</hi> there is no rejoycing in any thing, for we are <hi>nothing but Sinful:</hi> As for Conditions to get God's Favour, they knew none but Jeſus Chriſt, he was the great Condition, he being the great, only, compleat Saviour, the <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega,</hi> firſt and laſt, in our Salvation.

But this is honeſt, good, ſound Orthodox, yea, glorious Doctrine, in the Hearts of thoſe that have

For which plain dealing, need I beg the Biſhops Pardon.</p>

               <p>They proceed to evacuate our doing good Works, in order to get Salvation by them, and ſay farther, <hi>When we were periſhed, he ſaved us: And all theſe heavenly Treaſures are given us, not for our Deſerts, or good Deeds, which of our ſelves we have none</hi> (mark that we have none) <hi>but of his meer Mercy freely.</hi> Where do they leave room for Conditions, to make us meet for an Intereſt in Chriſt? Not a tittle of that; 'tis (they ſay) of <hi>meer Mercy freely.</hi> They proceed and ſay, <hi>If all this be freely, for whoſe ſake is it?</hi> and anſwer roundly, <hi>Truly for Christ's ſake; for whoſe ſake God is</hi> ('tis already done, God is) <hi>fully ſatisfied, pacified, and ſet at one with Man; He is the Lamb of God, that taketh away the Sins of the World.</hi> They aver, that God is now <hi>already</hi> pacified with Man; nay, and ſet <hi>at one</hi> with Man: They alſo ſcruple not to ſay, That Chriſt took away our very Sins; and inforce it from that excellent Scripture, <hi>With that one Oblation he hath made perfect, for evermore, them that are Sanctified.</hi> And this excellent Sermon they conclude a paſſage, which is for the great abaſing of Man, to take him off from truſting to his complying with the Terms of the Goſpel, or expecting to get God's Favour, as the Biſhop doth, by any thing that we can do. Thus they conclude, which I recommend to all that ſet up for doing ſo, as to expect ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance with God for it, <hi>Let us learn to know our ſelves</hi> (ſay they) <hi>without any cracking, and confeſs, that as of our ſelves cometh all Evil and Damnation, ſo likewiſe of him cometh all Goodneſs and Salvation.</hi> This muſt ſound harſh in our new <hi>Neonomian</hi> Divinity, nay, with ſome that pretend to go much nearer the Goſpel ſtrain, That <hi>nothing</hi> but Evil, <hi>nothing</hi> but Damnation, comes of our ſelves: What is our Prayers, Tears, Alms, Faſting, <hi>nothing</hi> but Evil, <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing</hi> but Damnation? Sure you great and good Reformers, you
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:41406:63" rendition="simple:additions"/> miſtake. No, we are ſure we are in the right: We don't ſay, you muſt not do good Works; no, not for a World: But we ſay, all our beſt Righteouſneſs, in point of Juſtification, or acceptance with God, as it is of our ſelves, as it is defiled and tainted by our cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Natures, ſo it is <hi>nothing</hi> but Evil, and ſo it is <hi>nothing</hi> but Damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.

The like caſe we have in the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> what good Deeds did God inſiſt on with him (as the Biſhop pleads) that he might gain God's Favour, when he was breathing out Blood and Slaughter againſt Chriſt in his Members, then it was our Bleſſed Lord Jeſus made it a time of his Love: For which, to him be Honour and Glory in the Churches, for ever and ever.</p>

               <p>But the Biſhop inſiſts on it, that it is but an <hi>Imaginary Change,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe (ſaith he) it is not proved, that Chriſt is that Sinfulneſs that we were, by his being made Sin, and we are the ſame Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs as he is, we being made the Righteouſneſs of God in him, the Biſhop ſaith, <hi>Here is a Change ſuppoſed, but I do not find it proved.</hi> What, not proved, when it is backed with plain Scripture, That he was made Sin for us, and we made the Righteouſneſs of God. Doth not this of neceſſity prove a Change? Could Chriſt poſſibly be made Sin for us, without taking on him our Perſons? Would you have it, That Chriſt was made Sin for himſelf? That would be horrid Bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſphemy: But to be made Sin for us, muſt infer, That he did truly beare, or ſuſtain, our Perſons, which is the Change argued for: Or if not, then he did not bear our Sins. And if ſo, What's become of
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:41406:63" rendition="simple:additions"/> the Goſpel, and our eternal Salvation?

               <p>I might refer the Biſhop again to the Doctrines of the Church; (whereof he is an Honourable Preſider), which, in this Caſe, run very clear Streams from the Fountain of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> and they (as I quoted before, out of the firſt part of the Sermon of <hi>Salvation</hi>) are wonderful clear, for ſuch a Change as the Doctor affirms, and Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> denies, ſaying, <hi>So that Chriſt is now the Righteouſneſs of all them that truly do believe in him. He for them paid their Ranſom by his Death, he for them fulfilled the Law in his Life; ſo that now IN HIM, and BY HIM, every true Chriſtian Man may be called a fulfiller of the Law.</hi> This Golden Sentence, which might be for an Ornament in Gold Letters, in every Houſe in <hi>England,</hi> doth fully vindicate, to a Tittle, Dr. <hi>Criſp</hi>'s Change of Perſons, Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf is their Righteouſneſs, he paid Ranſom for them, they were

               <p>One word more to the Biſhop's Argument, to prove that it is but an <hi>imaginary</hi> Notion, to think that we are compleatly Righteous, by the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, without any act of ours; which Argument of his is in theſe words, <hi>I could eaſily prove, that in all the Tranſactions between God and Mankind, ſome Conditions were required on our ſide, in order to his favour: So it was in the State of Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, ſo it continued after Man's Fall; as it appears by thoſe words of God to</hi> Cain, <hi>If thou doſt well, ſhalt thou not be accepted; if thou doſt not well, Sin lyeth at the door?</hi> Gen. 4.7. 'Tis ſtrange ſo <hi>great</hi> a Man ſhould offer ſo weak an Argument, to argue from a ſtate of Innocency, or from the ſtate of Reprobate <hi>Cain,</hi> or from the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Works, what belongs to the Elect under the Covenant of Grace, and under the Goſpel, where Works and Grace are made oppoſite Terms; <hi>If of Works, then no more of Grace,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle. Was not <hi>Abel firſt accepted,</hi> and then his Offering? Is not the firſt Promiſe all of Grace, <hi>He</hi> (Chriſt) <hi>ſhall bruiſe thine</hi> (the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil's) <hi>Head?</hi> And is not the laſt Promiſe the like, <hi>Whoever will, let him take of the Water of Life freely?</hi> But by the Biſhop's Doctrine, a clever way is made to overthrow the whole Goſpel, <hi>To you is born a Saviour,</hi> and to ſubvert the Orthodox Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England</hi> at once, by bringing from the Dead the Covenant of Works, to be ſaved by our doing well, and not by Chriſt's doing and dying for us: Whereas <hi>Abel</hi>'s Sacrifice was accepted, he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf being firſt accepted, and his Sacrifice being offered in Faith; but <hi>Cain</hi> and his Sacrifice rejected, being not offered in Faith, not look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Jeſus alone for Salvation by him.

               <p>Then for the Doctrine of the Church, ſee what that ſaith of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, or of any Works of ours, to gain God's Favour. In the ſecond Sermon of <hi>Salvation,</hi> the good Chriſtians of thoſe days, that were ſinged by the Popiſh Fires in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> days, they tell us, <hi>So that the true underſtanding this Doctrine, That we be juſtified by Faith freely without Works, or that we be juſtified by Faith in Chriſt only, is not that this our own Act, to believe in Chriſt, or this our Faith in Chriſt, which is within us, doth juſtifie us.</hi> A Sentence fit to be ingraven in every Church in <hi>England,</hi> in order to take Men from truſting to their Repentance, or good Works. The like again is in the ſame Sermon, as followeth, <hi>We muſt renounce the Merit of Faith, Hope, Charity, and all other Vertues and good Deeds— And we muſt truſt only in God's Mercy, and that Sacrifice, which our High Prieſt and Saviour, Chriſt Jeſus, once offered— As great, and as goodly, a Vertue as lively Faith is, yet it putteth us from it ſelf, and remitteth, and appointeth us unto Chriſt, for to have only by him Remiſſion of our Sins.</hi> Obſerve theſe Eminent Stars, of the firſt Magnitude, in the Heaven of that Church of Old, they are ſo far from bringing in our Repentance, Charity and good Deeds, or any act of ours, to obtain Favour with God, which the Biſhop pleads for, that they exclude <hi>Faith it ſelf,</hi> as having any hand in juſtifying us, any farther than as it <hi>remitteth</hi> us to Chriſt. But alas! how is our Gold become Droſs? How are our great Men fallen from the Pure, Primitive Doctrines of the Church of <hi>England?</hi> And though they live ſplendidly, by ſubſcribing to theſe Doctrines, yet in their Preaching and Writing they miſerably warp (as here in part) from them. Witneſs the ſetting up ſome Acts of ours to be done, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to obtain God's Favour. And becauſe God treated with <hi>Adam,</hi> on account of <hi>Do and live,</hi> therefore 'tis ſuppoſed <hi>monſtrouſly,</hi> that Men, when dead in Sins, muſt work for Life; or as the Biſhop, The Miniſtry of Reconciliation in St. <hi>Paul,</hi> is wholly <hi>founded on Conditions</hi> on our ſide, which he calls <hi>Acts</hi> of ours, and may as well be called our <hi>good Works:</hi> And all this becauſe the Apoſtle pray'd them to be reconciled to God, which cannot well be conſtrued to be more, than to pray them to accept the Reconciliation which God had made of Sinners to himſelf, by Chriſt at his Death: For if, as the Apoſtle ſaith, God was in Chriſt, reconciling the World to himſelf, then the Work was done when Chriſt cryed out on the Croſs, <hi>It is
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:41406:65"/> finiſhed.</hi> And if the word of Reconciliation was committed to the Apoſtles, to publiſh to the World the Reconciliation that God had made of Sinners to himſelf by Chriſt, what could his Embaſſadors mean, in praying Sinners to be reconciled to God, but to accept of what he had mentioned before, of the act done long before, <hi>viz.</hi> That God had reconciled Sinners to himſelf by Chriſt; and to let them know, that they were ſome of the reconciled ones, if they would accept thereof, and take theſe Waters of Life freely, and ſo accept the Exhortation, as <hi>Titus</hi> did, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.17.</p>

And what greater Argument, of the difference of Good and Evil, than Chriſt's ſuffering ſo great an Evil, as the bearing our Sins, that we might have ſo great a Good as Reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to God, Pardon and Eternal Salvation, thereby?

And this Love of God in Chriſt, being ſhed abroad in our Hearts, will conſtrain us ſo to do, much more than all the thundring Terrors of the Law, which only work Condemnation. But this Grace of God bringing Salvation, this teaches effectually to deny ungodlineſs, and to live righteouſly, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Therefore I humbly conceive the Biſhop is out, in ſaying, <hi>It makes us apt to leſſen the Divine Perfections;</hi> whereas all the Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in Hell, of all final Unbelievers to all Eternity, cannot ſo heighten and glorifie the Juſtice and Holineſs of God, as our Lord Jeſus ſhedding his precious Blood, which is called the Blood of God,

But the great Jealouſie is, That Men think, if Chriſt did really bear the Sins of the Elect, the very Murder and Adultery of <hi>David, &amp;c.</hi> that this did <hi>defile</hi> and <hi>taint</hi> the Holy Nature of Jeſus Chriſt; and ſo they would infer, that the Free Grace Teachers would be ſaved by a defiled, polluted Saviour: Whereas there is nothing more incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent; for there is none that believes the infinite, incomprehenſible Holineſs and Purity of our Lord Jeſus, Holy with all the perfection of Holineſs, as God his Eternal Father is Holy, but muſt conclude, it is impoſſible that his Holy Nature ſhould be tainted or polluted by the Sins of the Elect, charged upon him, and lying upon him; for if inſtead of bearing the Sins only of all that the Father had given to him, he being God-Man, he had born the Sins of Ten Thouſand Worlds full of Sinners, they could not have defiled his Holy Nature, there being an infinite diſproportion between his infinite Holineſs, and Man's finite Sins; ſo that they could no more defile him, than a Viper's, or a Toad's, ſpitting Poyſon againſt the Sun can defile the Sun: Therefore I ſay with boldneſs, If we believe our Lord Jeſus to be true God, and conſider the infinite Purity of this Holy God, our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, in our Humane Nature, we cannot conceive that this Humane Nature could poſſibly be tainted or contaminated by his being made Sin for us, and by bearing our Sin; for the ſame Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that ſaith, God made him to be Sin for us, ſaith alſo, <hi>He knew
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:41406:66"/> no Sin;</hi> that is, ſo as to be in his Holy Perſon guilty of any Sin of his own, or to allow of any Sin to go unpuniſhed.</p>

               <p>It would do well for all that ſtumble at our Sins, our very Sins being by God laid on Chriſt, and he, as our Surety, made Sin for us; and that think, that this will leſſen the Divine Perfections, and our Senſe, of the difference of Good and Evil; to conſider that our Lord Jeſus is called by the ſame Name as the Sacrifices of old were called, that had the Sins of the People laid on them, they were called <hi>Sin,</hi> ſo is our Lord Jeſus. Nay, he compares himſelf to the <hi>Serpent;</hi> Was the Serpent curſed beyond all the Beaſts of the Field? Chriſt is ſaid to be made a Curſe for us: Did the Brazen Serpent lifted up, heal all that look'd to it, of their Stings of the Fiery Serpents? So ſaith our Lord Jeſus, As the Serpent was lifted up, ſhall the Son of Man be, <hi>That whoſoever believeth in him,</hi> (that being taken for looking to him and being Saved) <hi>he ſhall not periſh, but have everlaſting Life.</hi> Can any ſober Chriſtian think, that God himſelf would leſſen the Divine Perfections of his Nature, or of his Son Jeſus who is one with himſelf? Whom he charges all Men to <hi>Honour,</hi> as they Honour the Father, by his giving up his Son to Death for us all; and by putting our Sins on him, and giving the Name of Sin; and comparing him to the Serpent for being a Curſe. We ſhould rather, from hence, learn the Infinite Love of the Father and the Son, and his Infinite Hatred of Sin; inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as nothing could expiate it, or take out the Stain of it from us, but the Blood of him that was God.</p>

               <p>And becauſe our whole Concern, to all Eternity, depends on God's making Chriſt to be Sin for us, and thereby glorifying the Divine Perfections of his Wiſdom, Holineſs and Goodneſs, not leſſening them (as is intimated.) I think it may, to ſome, be uſeful, to give an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance or two of the Sacrifices, that had the Sins of the People laid on them, how they, as Types of Chriſt, were called Sin, they are in near 100 places called <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Guilt,</hi> and yet at the ſame time they were called <hi>Moſt Holy;</hi> as in <hi>Lev.</hi> 6.17. it is ſaid of the Meat-offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>It is moſt Holy as the Sin-offering and the Treſpaſs-offering;</hi> and more plainly in v. 25. <hi>This is the Law of the ſin-offering, it ſhall be killed before the Lord: It is moſt Holy.</hi> Nay, ſo Holy it was, that in Verſe 27. it is ſaid, <hi>Whoſoever ſhall touch the fleſh thereof, ſhall be holy.</hi> Now though theſe were ſo Holy, yet it is to be obſerved,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:41406:66"/> that in both theſe places, the 17th and 25th Verſes, that the word which we tranſlate Sin-offering, is in the Original only <hi>Sin,</hi> the word being <hi>Chattath:</hi> So that when the Peoples Sins were laid, by God's appointment, on the Beaſt, then the Beaſt was, by God, called the <hi>Sin,</hi> as Chriſt was called <hi>Sin,</hi> or made, by God, <hi>Sin</hi> for us, by our <hi>Sins</hi> being laid on him; and yet notwithſtanding that, the Goat had the Sins of the People laid on him, and therefore called <hi>Sin;</hi> yet at the ſame time it is moſt Holy, or <hi>Holineſs of Holineſſes, Kodeſh Kada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhim:</hi> In anſwer to which, when God made Chriſt to be Sin, he ſaith of him, That he knew no Sin, he being moſt Holy, <hi>Holineſs of Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes,</hi> untainted, undefiled with our Sins; he was at the ſame time the Lamb of God, <hi>without Spot</hi> in himſelf, and need there was for it, for if he had not been Holy to the Extremity of Holineſs, in his own Nature and Perſon, he had not been fit to be made a Sin offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for us: If he had had the leaſt ſpeck of Sin in him, or could have been tainted with our Sin, he had not then been a meet Sacrifice to take away our ſin; Though he was made ſin, yet it was <hi>our</hi> ſin, he was made ſin for <hi>us:</hi> Was the poor Beaſt made ſin in it ſelf, or for it ſelf, when the ſins of the People were laid typically on it? No ſure; for if it were, the Scape-goat could not have been led into the Wilderneſs, but the ſin would have ſunk it down dead immediately: The ſin it was made, was the Peoples ſin, as the ſin Chriſt was made, was our ſin.</p>

               <p>This may poſſibly be the better underſtood, and the more readily aſſented to, by ſeriouſly conſidering the Infinite Perfection of the Holy Nature of the Bleſſed Son of God, which was and is the ſame in the Man Chriſt Jeſus, as in the Godhead of the Father; he and the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther being one in Eſſence, and in all the glorious Perfections of the Godhead. This Conſideration may, by the Operation of the Holy Spirit, reconcile our Thoughts to this Truth, That though Chriſt was made Sin for us, and a Curſe for us, by having our Sins laid on him, and by his hanging on the Tree for us, yet his Holy Imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culate Perſon was not in the leaſt tainted or defiled thereby; nay, God ſo ordered it, that his holy Fleſh, when dead, ſhould not ſee the leaſt Corruption. This appears clear, becauſe the Infinite Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Godhead, in the Man Chriſt Jeſus, was of ſuch Infinite Perfection in him, that the Sins of Men falling on him, they being but Finite, muſt of neceſſity be evacuated, exinanitiated, expiated
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:41406:67" rendition="simple:additions"/> and purged away by Infinite Perfection. As a little for Illuſtration, Suppoſe a ſmall drop of Water, out of a Smith's Trough, ſhould fall on a glowing red-hot large piece of Iron, Can this defile or hurt the Iron? No; 'tis immediately evaporated in Smoak. 'Tis true, the Humanity of our Lord Jeſus, might be, and was, <hi>affected</hi> with our ſins, ſo as to cry out, <hi>My Soul is troubled,</hi> but he was not in the leaſt <hi>infected</hi> with them, his Humanity being made perfectly Holy, by Union and Oneneſs with the Divine Nature in an ineffable manner (at his very firſt Conception, his Humane Nature being called that holy thing <hi>Luke</hi> 1.35.) ſo that he was untainted by our ſins being laid on him, which he purged away by the offering up of himſelf in the Fire of God's Wrath upon him for ſin.</p>

               <p>We will ſuppoſe again, That all the Gold in the World ſhould be put into a vaſt Cauldron, and Ten hundred thouſand load of Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coal under it, and about it, melting the Gold; and while this vaſt Fire is glowing with an unconceivable heat, the Refiner ſhould caſt a ſmall drop of Poyſon into the Furnace where this boyling Gold is, Would not this drop of Poyſon be conſumed at its firſt falling into the Furnace, without defiling the Gold? So the ſins of the Elect, though they deſerve Hell Fire to all Eternity on the guilty Sinners, yet theſe ſins, when laid on the Perſon of God-Man Jeſus Chriſt, who hath infinitely more Holineſs than our ſins have of Deliquity or Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity in them: When theſe ſins were laid on our Lord Jeſus, they could no more taint our Lord Jeſus, than the drop of Poyſon could taint all the Gold in the Furnace. Wherefore it is ſaid by the Holy Spirit, when he is giving an account of the glorious Perfection of the Divine Nature of Chriſt, in <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.3. calling him the Brightneſs (the Effulgency) of the Father's Glory, the expreſs Image of his Perſon, the Upholder of all things by the Word of his Power: The very firſt, and next, effect of all this glorious Excellency in the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Chriſt is, <hi>when he had by himſelf purged our Sins:</hi> As much as to ſay, this great Character that is here given to Jeſus Chriſt, which mortifies the <hi>Socinians,</hi> is given for this very purpoſe, to ſhew us, how he, by <hi>himſelf,</hi> by his own glorious Perfection, as the Bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Father's Glory, when our ſins were laid on him, he by <hi>himſelf,</hi> without any aſſiſtance or Cooperation of us, or any Man or Angel, he by <hi>himſelf,</hi> ſaith the Holy Ghoſt, purged our ſins, he made a perfect Expiation of them, the <hi>glowing Holineſs</hi> of the Divine

               <p>By this I hope we may ſee, that the Conſideration of the moſt <hi>adorable Holineſs</hi> in our Lord Jeſus, may reconcile us to ſuch Paſſages as we find in the Scripture, of his bearing our ſins, and his being made Sin and a Curſe for us, without any ground of charging it with ſuch bad Conſequences as the Biſhop intimates, That this tends to leſſen our Reverence of the Divine Perfections, whereas nothing can heighten our Reverence more: for this ſhews, that his Divine Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections were ſo Infinite, that by bearing our Sins in his Body on the Tree, and by offering himſelf, with our Sins on him, a Sacrifice to God for Sin, he thereby expiated and purged all the Sins of all the Elect; one of which, by reaſon of the infinitely Holy Nature and Law of God, would have ſunk all the Angels in Heaven to Hell, if by God laid on them: Therefore, inſtead of diminiſhing our Eſteem of the <hi>Divine Perfections,</hi> becauſe Chriſt hath borne away our Sins for ever, freely, without any Conditions or Works of ours to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce him: Let us, by all means, endeavour to magnifie them; and for the Riches of the Grace of God, and our Lord Jeſus therein, Let us fall down and <hi>adore</hi> him that ſits on the Throne, and the Lamb in the midſt of the Throne, for that he, of his free Grace, hath loved us, and waſhed us from our Sins in his Blood; and ſing with the four Beaſts, and 24 Elders, with the People in the four parts of the World, and with the Miniſters of our Lord Jeſus, Thou art worthy, for thou waſt ſlain, and haſt redeemed us to God by thy Blood (without one word of Condition, but) with <hi>thy Blood, thy Blood, thy Blood.</hi> And let us ſay as that Number did, which was ten thouſand times ten thouſand, and thouſands of thouſands, with a loud Voice, with higheſt Acclamations, <hi>Worthy is the Lamb that was ſlain, to receive Power, Riches, Wiſdom, Strength, Honour, Glory, Bleſſing: And every Creature on the Earth, under the Earth, and in the Sea, heard I, ſaying,</hi> (ſaith St. <hi>John) Bleſſing, Honour, Glory and Power, be unto him that ſits on the Throne, and the Lamb for ever.</hi> And the ſame ſaith he that begs Pardon of God for his
